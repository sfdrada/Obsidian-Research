# How To Take Smart Notes

# Chapter 0 - Introduction
Writing:
- To organize
- To remember something
- To exchange

 
 
 Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.
- No immediate negative feedback
- Organization  & strategy overlooked
- Belief that writing starts with a blank page
	- Productive writing starts w/ note taking


*"The single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people’s heads, but in the way they do their everyday work."* 



## Self-Discipline & Self-Control

### It is not so important who you are, but what you do.
- Smarter > Harder 


[[Willpower]] is a limited resource, depletes quickly and hard to improve
- self-control and self-discipline  have  much  more  to  do  with  our environment than  with ourselves. 
- No willpower when you want to do something
	- Efficient long lasting work = ST & LT goals aligned
		- PIC

If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head or forcing progress and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas
- [[Nikola Tesla]] [[Visualization]] 
	- Top-Down breakdown ???
		- Micro goals 
		- [[Research/Other/Flow]] 



Procrastination & Motivation: 
- Problematic work routines that take charge instead of allowing us to steer ourselves. 
	- [[Chapter 7 - How To Get Cooperation]]


Structure != Plans
- A clear structure != making plans
	-  Plans can impose an inflexible structure
		- Forcing a plan -> more [[Willpower]] & less [[Research/Other/Flow]]
			- Demotivating
			- Not good for open-ended processes
				- Constantly adjust plan w/ new insights
				- Insight & new ideas catalyze [[Research/Other/Flow]]


[[Dunning-Kreuger Effect]]
- Bad students don't self reflect and are confident in their answers due to a lack of skill or interest in finding contradicting evidence.   
- Good students raise the bar focusing on what they haven’t learned and mastered yet.
	- Imposter Syndrome -  The feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, you are


## Good Solutions Are Simple & Unexpected

Subcategorizing
- Looks less complex but can become very complicated
- Reduces the ability to find connections
	- Usability vs. Usefulness



How To Deal With Complexity -> Simplify as much as possible and follow a few basic principles.




Even the best tool will not improve your productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routine.
- In changing any [[Habits]] , you are drawn back to your old ways.

[[Routine]] - Simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamless.

Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place.

Create a process that collects all tasks in one location to efficiently sort through
- Get rid of [[Working Memory]] usage

Best note taking system = holistic perspective
- everything is taken care of to smooth out future conflicts
	- [[Trading Strategy]] 
		- Open ended process vs. close ended process?
- Even the best tools won’t make much of a difference if they are used in isolation. Only if they are embedded in a well-conceived working process can the tools play out their strengths.
	- Have the right tools & use them effectively
- Only if you can trust your system & everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.


## The Slip-Box

```ad-quote
title: Niklas Luhmman
He never forced himself to do something he didn’t feel like, he even said: “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.”
```


Even hard work can be fun as long as it is aligned with our intrinsic goals and we feel in control.

```ad-danger
Do Not Force A Rigid Structure
Do Not Force Work Misaligned With Intrinsic Goals


```





Studies on highly successful people have proven that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance & prevent resistance.

- Right mindset vs. right workflow

## The Slip-Box Manual


He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another. It was very much like a translation where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the original meaning as  truthfully as possible. 


He did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers.
- Before computers and backlinks
- If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note 
- By alternating numbers and letters, with some slashes and commas in between, he was able to branch out into as many strings of thought as he liked. 
	- 21/3d7a7 following a note with the number 21/3d7a6.
	- Whenever he added a note, he checked for other relevant notes to make possible connections
	- Another way is by adding a link on this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system
		- Hyperlink
- misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique.
- Developed topics bottom up 
	-Sort a topic by sorting the links of the relevant other notes.
- The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points.

| Rough Draft | Final Paper |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| - quotes    | - revision  |
| - ideas     |             |

No matter how internal processes are implemented, you need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.”
```

If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense.



# Writing A Paper Step By Step

1. Make fleeting notes
	- Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind.
		- Phone notes
		- Voice recording -> notes
		- paper 
2. Make notes while you consume content
	- Use your own words
	- Mark the place you got the info
3. Make permanent notes
	- Go through your notes for the day and transfer them to your vault. 
	- Create connections
		- Develop > Collect
			- Ideas
			- Discussions
			- Questions
		- Contradict
		- Support
		- Add
	- 1 note for each idea
		- Full sentences
		- Sources & References
4. Add permanent notes to slip-box
	- Interconnect notes on graph
	- Ability to effectively find what you want
5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. 
	- Missing information & questions
	- Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about
	- Build upon what you have
	- Do not brainstorm for a topic. 
		- Random note puller
	- Don’t cling to an idea if another, more promising one gains momentum.
	- PIC snowball
6. Developed interconnected ideas will turn into entire topics.
	- Start organizing all of your interconnected thoughts on the topic 
	- Remove redundancy and add what's missing
7. Turn your creation into a rough draft 
	- Coherent w/ context & purpose
	- Look for weak points
8. Edit & proofread manuscript
	- Congratulate yourself

```ad-info

You never just work on one idea, but many ideas in different stages at the same time.
```


Gather what you encounter along your way and don’t let any good idea go to waste


We constantly encounter interesting ideas along the way and only a fraction of them are useful for the particular paper we started reading it for


Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass that turns a mere collection of ideas into an idea-generator


The best ideas are usually the ones we haven’t anticipated anyway.
