# The Collapse Of Babylon

all civilizations have come and fallen

ourselves being our own demise
- no morality
- no connection with spirit

When the ship is sinking, remember to keep your morality high and connection with the source


When you start to untether your soul, your morality becomes so high your not going to do what the matrix wants you to do


Don't be willing to sell your soul


"I thought I was preparing my whole life to live but I was actually preparing my whole life to die" - Nevile Goddard



common thread in all religions that our souls will be judged as human beings. We can get to the point in our own life where we are the judge of our own soul and become stronger. 
- when you get connected you can really feel the impact inside you

The fundamental thing at the heart of reality is emotions
- not thinking/intellectualizing
- emotions = energy


the body is the temple of god

as above so below

The whole is within you

[[Egyptian Jed]]



Everything is already a lesson

If you're all higher beings your not susceptible to being controlled 


humbleness to accept that there are a lot of things you don't know and its ok. 


Work on the process of processing emotions. As you work on the emotions you evolve -> [[Chakras]]
