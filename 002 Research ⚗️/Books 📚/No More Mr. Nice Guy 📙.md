[[Integration]]


**This transformation requires a complete change in a person's paradigm than just action


**Paradigm** A Roadmap to navigate life
- subconscious
- determines a lonoger degree of our attitudes & behaviors
- Filter for life experiences
	- Data that does not fit the subconscous mindset is filtered out of conscious awareness
	- Data that does fit the subconscious paradigm is magnified supporting current belief set
- Can be outdated/innacurate
- Most developed when young
- Rarely evaluated + updated since unconscious
- Assumed to be 100% accurate even when not


**Nice Guy Paradigm** If I can hide my flaws  & become what I want me to be, then I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem free life.
- Try harder when things arne't working out
- Inclination to cling to faulty paragidms
	- Extremely embedded subsconiscously = slow adapter


Difficult for nice guys to consider changing strategy

*"The only thing his paradigm ever did was to creat a a distraction from fear, worthlessness, and inadequacy"*

Nice guys believe they have to do everything on their onwn and hide signs of weakness


**The most effective tool to break from the Nice guy syndrome is to find a good supportive male group

Breaking Free Acitivity 1:
- Write down 3 support groups/safe people that might be a support for your growth from this mindset

1. Breaking free from the nice guy syndrome requires a radical change in perspectvie and behavior
	- Not fully committing only creates needless pain
2. These changes will significantly affect you and your relationship dynamics
	- Don't be afraid of growth towards a worthy ideal


Why do people hide their true self from others? = Why do people try to change who they really are?
- Because it is not acceptable to be just who you are
	- sacrificng one self to be something else is not loving ones self for who you are

## How The Nice Guys Are Created

**The most impressionable time for a guy is from 0-5 years old

1. When children come into the world, theya re helpless
	- Greatest fear is abandonment = death
2. Children are ego centered (they are the cause of everything that happend to them)
	- Will believe that he is the cause of abandonment to him

- not fed
- not cajoled
- lonely
- angry at him
- neglect
- unrealistic expectations
- shame
- hits him
- uses for gratifying parent
- parent leaves
- parent doesn't want you

**Every child has abandonment experiences
- Even the belief that tey are the cause is innacurate


Belief that it's not acceptable for you to be who you are just as you are
- No way of realizing these abandonment needs are casued by the caretakers rather than your own fault

**Toxic Shame** The belief that youa re inherently bad, deffective, different, or unloveable. 



1. Try to cope w/ emotional + physical stress from being abandoned
2. Try to prevent simialr events from happening again
3. Try to hide their toxic shame from themselves & others
	- Many possible narratives to deal w/ toxic shames

Progression from perfect little boy -> Nice guy
1. Abandonment
2. Internalization of toxic shame
3. Create of survival mecahnisms


**All nice guys internalize the same belief**
- There must be something wrong w/ me because...
- I'm only good enough/lovable when...

Survival Mechanism Paradigm:
- If I can hide my flaws & become what I think tohers want to believe, then I will be loved, get my needs met, and ahave a problem free life
	- Even though it is inneffective/faulty, it is the only roadmap these guys have

1. Nice guy exagerrates hisntoxic shame & believes he's the worst kind of person
	- Convinced everyone can see how bad he is
	- His only hope for happiness is to mask his inherent badnes
		- Does nt believe people will believe his nice guy persona

1. Represses his core belief about his worthlessness & believs he's the nicest guy you will ever meet
	- Minor and correctable personal flaws
	- Does everythign right
	- All the good he does makes him a good person


**Both are just wounded souls based on the innaccurate perception of the events of their childhood


**It's not essential to uncover every bad experience**, but it is helpful to udnerstand script origins to rework them.


Naming childhood experiecnes isntead opf blaming will alow you to replace the original script




Social changes that accerlated Nice Guy Syndrome:
- Industrial economy 
- Urban families
- increase in divorce, single parent homes, homes headed by women
- abscence of father figures
- sexual revolution
- Reducational system dominated by women
- womens liberation & feminism
- vietnam war
- The pill


These changes created 3 important dynamics:
1. Boys seperated from fathers & male role models
2. Boys left to be  raised by women
	- Being a man defined by women and requiring validaiton
3. Radical feminism implied men were bad & unecessary

**Many nice guys have developed female perspective of masculinity




The habits of highly innefective Men:
- keep trying harder, doing more of the same
- seeking the apporval of others
- Hide their personal flaws/mistakes
- putting other peoples needs & wants before their own
- sacrificnig their personal power & playing victim
- dissociating form other men & their own masculinity
- cocreating relationships that are les than satisfying
- not having great sex
- failing to live up to their full potential


Learn How To Please Yoursef:
1. Just about everything a Nice Guy does is to consciously/unconiscoiusly gain apporval or avoid dissapporval from just about any relationship
2. Seeking approval - They don't believe they're ok justy as they are
	- Try to find ways that get them approval & value
		- Attatching identity & worth to object instead of an innate belief that htey themselves is valuable


**Seeking womens approvbal gives them the ability to set the tgone of the realtionship
- Seeking this approval craewtes rage towards women

		- Blindly intensify our acts of worship
		- Righteously lash out in anger

How would you act if you didn't need the approval of others?
