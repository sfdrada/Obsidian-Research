For a marriage to really work, you have to grow together, accept one another (flaws and all), keep the passion alive, know each other on a deep level, respect and understand each other, support them, defend and stand up for them, and work as a team. 

Myths:
1. personality problems ruin a marriage
2. Myth 2 – common interests keep you together
3. Myth 3 – avoiding conflict will ruin your marriage
4. Myth 4 – affairs are the root of divorce
5. Myth 5 – men are not biologically built for marriage


The determining factor in whether wives feel satisfied with the sex, romance, and passion in their marriage is, by 70 percent, the quality of the couple’s friendship. For men, the determining factor is, by 70 percent, the quality of the couple’s friendship.



## What Makes A Marriage Work

- Mutual respect
- Attunement – mutual understanding of each other on a core emotional level
- Positive sentiment override (PSO) – look for your partner’s good qualities, give each other the benefit of the doubt, have positive expectations of each other
- Trust and commitment
- Assume the best about each other
- Acknowledge each other’s perspective
- Support each other’s hopes and aspirations
- Build a sense of purpose


## How To Predict Divorce

It's not what they argue about but the way they do

**Harsh start up** – Negative, accusatory, criticism, and sarcasm at the onset of any debate/talk.

### The Four Horsemen

Criticism – attack on character and “you” statements. Critical of each other. A complaint on the other hand is ok.


Contempt (as well as sarcasm and cynicism) – a sense of superiority over one’s partner. Name calling, mockery, etc.

Defensiveness – an indirect way of blaming your partner

Stonewalling – tuning out the other partner



**Flooding** – psychologically or physically overwhelmed due to an overly negative spouse. People (usually men) stonewall to protect against this. Repeated flooding leads to emotional distancing, and then loneliness.

**Body language** – repeated episodes of flooding cause severe emotional distress as well as elevated heart rate, etc. (think fight or flight response)





**Failed repair attempts** – a repair attempt is something that is done to help stop an argument from getting out of hand. It can be any statement or action – a silly gesture like sticking your tongue out, taking a break, saying sorry, laughing, or making a weird face. Some couples have certain repair attempts they stick to that help deescalate a fight. When these repair attempts stop working, it can lead to increased emotional tension and flooding. Often, in a failing marriage, a feedback loop develops between the four horsemen and failed repair attempts. When the four horsemen rear their ugly head, the marriage has an 82% chance at failing. Add in the failed repair attempt and it jumps to over 90%.


**Bad memories** – Couples who look back on their early days with fond memories are happier and more likely to stay together than those that look to their early days with a negative view. In happy marriages, past highlights are remembered rather than the low points. They remember how positive and excited they felt at the beginning of the relationship.

 we usually notice marital troubles once we have a big fight. It’s at that point we really reflect on the marriage and say, “If we didn’t fight or if we could stop it from getting out of control, our marriage would be great”. But John states that **the key to divorce proofing or reviving a relationship is all about how you engage with each other when you’re not fighting**. Coping with conflict is important, but **first you have to strengthen the friendship and trust between each other.**



## Enhancing Your Love Map

The idea here is to know and understand your partner at the core level. Enhancing your love map is expanding and deepening your knowledge of each other. This should be fun… not a chore.


 The love map is all the information about your spouse’s world, and you need to be intimately familiar with it to have a fulfilling and happy marriage. You have to know what your partner is thinking and feeling to create that feeling of togetherness.


Not only are the exercises good for getting to know your partner, but they will also help you discover more about yourself. Ask yourself, what are my triumphs and strivings, my good times and bad times, my goals and aspirations, my mission in life, and who do you want to become? What’s my emotional world like – How do I express my emotions (like anger, affection, love, and pride) and what’s my philosophy on expressing emotions? Do some self-discovery in the process and share this information with each other. Share your inner self with your partner! That's how you really get to know someone.





## Nurture your fondness and admiration – cherish each other

Remember when you first started dating your spouse and you had so much excitement towards him/her? You honored and respected them. Over time, it can feel like we begin to take each other for granted and then before you know it, we are not really honoring and respecting each other anymore.

 remind yourself of your spouse’s positive qualities – focus on their good qualities and actions. Additionally, let your partner know what you love about them and what you’re grateful for.


when we get very comfortable with someone, we can lose sight of that line of respect. Search for and express gratitude for your partner’s positive behavior.


**realize how valuable your partner is**. Think about what makes you treasure him or her. Acknowledge and openly discuss positive aspects of your partner. There are several more exercises in the book on how to nurture fondness and admiration







## Turn Toward Each Other Instead Of Away


Romance is kept alive in the small daily acts of affection. On a daily basis, we bid for each other’s attention, affection, support, and humor.

During these requests for attention and affection, we either turn away or turn towards our partner. When you turn toward your partner, you’re strengthening the trust, passion, emotional connection, and sexual satisfaction in your relationship.




There’s a reason that seemingly small events are fundamental to a relationship’s future: each time partners turn toward each other, they are funding what I’ve come to call their emotional bank account.

Pay attention to these mini moments – they are opportunities to help your relationship grow. The secret to reconnecting isn’t to go on a fancy vacation, it’s noticing the small moments in everyday life where you can make an impact.

Make an effort to listen to your spouse, respond with thought, and help him or her. In doing so, you will make your marriage more romantic and stable. Two things to be aware of: some bids (for attention, affection, support) are wrapped in anger or another negative emotion. Focus on the bid and not the delivery.

Practice being more present with your partner – be aware and pay attention to them (not glued to your phone all the time).

> Couples often ignore each other’s emotional needs out of mindlessness, not malice.



 The stress reducing conversation. **At the end of the day, reunite and talk about how your day went** (for 20 minutes). Do it during a time you are both in the mood to talk. **This isn’t a time to discuss marital issues**, it’s a time to discuss other areas of your life.



**How to cope with your partner’s sadness, fear, and anger** – be there for your partner, see the world from their perspective, and empathize with negative feelings.

> When you are in pain, the world stops and I listen

1 – Acknowledge the difficulty of confronting negative emotions

2 – Self soothe if your partner is overwhelming you (more to come on how to do that)

3 – Try to understand their perspective (don’t problem solve)

4 – Use exploratory and open-ended questions to get to the problem (tell me more, what are your concerns? etc.)

5 – Don’t ask why, instead ask “what”. Why questions can sound like criticism.

6 – Bear witness – witnessing your partner’s distress and repeat back what your partner says in your own words.


Additional tips – ask what’s missing, don’t try to cheer up your partner, don’t take anything personally, don’t tell your partner to calm down (this can mean their feelings aren’t justified), search out the goal and obstacle, express understanding and empathy, and don’t minimize it.


## Let Your Partner Influence You


Make your spouse a partner in your decision making. Respect and honor their opinions and feelings.

This doesn’t mean men should give up all their power and let their wives run their lives! Ha. It means that couples should share decision making, allow sharing of power, and search for common ground. Think about it, do you really want to make decisions that leave your wife feeling deprived?


. Simply showing your willingness to work together in finding a solution will soften your partner up.




When a husband accepts his wife’s influence, he also strengthens their friendship.

Accepting influence doesn’t mean never expressing negative emotions toward your partner. Marriages can survive plenty of flashes of anger, complaints, even criticism. Trying to suppress negative feelings in your spouse’s presence wouldn’t be good for your marriage or your blood pressure.

The more open to influence both partners are, the smoother a marriage.


**Learn to yield to your partner.** Try to respond to the message rather than the tone of your partner’s voice. When it’s an abrasive or negative tone, view that as an expression of how important the issue is to them – not an attack on you. Look for the reasonable part of a request and find common ground – compromise. Sharing power = respecting the other person’s view.



There are two types of conflict; perpetual and solvable. Perpetual problems are those that never go away – conflicts over kids, sex, housework, religion, etc. Perpetual problems, if not dealt with, can kill the relationship. The other type, solvable problems, can be dealt with some conflict resolution techniques. Solvable problems are typically less personal, painful, and intense than the perpetual ones.


you don’t have to resolve your major marital conflicts for your marriage to thrive.



Negative emotions are important and hold crucial information. Listen to your partner’s negative emotions without feeling attacked. Remember to be gentle with each other.


No one is right – there are two sides to every story.





No one will take your advice without them knowing that you understand where they are coming from.



Focus on fondness and admiration, especially if you’re having a hard time seeing your partner’s perspective. Let them know that they are loved and accepted “warts and all”. Pardon each other and give up on past resentments.



## Solve Your Solvable Problems


Traditional techniques focus on putting yourself in your partner’s shoes and then empathizing with your partner. The problem is, it’s hard to put yourself in their shoes when the person they are having a problem with is you. So, John has a different approach.

1 – **soften your start up**



  
share some of the responsibility, express how you feel about a specific situation, express what you need. It must be devoid of criticism and contempt.


complain but don’t blame, make statements that start with I instead of you, describe what is happening (don’t judge), be clear about your positive need, be polite, be appreciative, don’t store things up.


**Learn to make and receive repair attempts**. Learn to terminate discussion or de-escalate them before they spiral out of control.

 If you have to, be more formal at first so that the message is getting through to your spouse.

Accept the repair attempt if your partner tries one as well (this is an example of principle 4, accepting your partner’s influence).


**Soothe yourself and each other**.


If you’re getting flooded, end the discussion. Take a 20-minute break and listen to music, take a walk, meditate, or read. Suspend any feelings of innocent victim-hood (why is she always attacking me) and righteous indignation (I don’t have to take this). Soothe your partner as well (only if you are calm).

 Discuss what makes us feel flooded, what soothes them and yourself, and what signals can we use to show we are feeling flooded.


**Compromise**

 Once you’ve followed the steps above, you can negotiate and accommodate each other. **Practice gratitude for what you have and don’t try to alter your spouse**. Be open-minded: consider their position before you become completely entrenched in your own.


> Search for the part of your spouse’s perspective that an objective bystander would consider reasonable.


**When you want to tackle a solvable problem**, sit down and find common ground. 




**Dealing with emotional injuries**. Address any past issues that need processing. All experience is subjective and this means that both sides have validity.






Maintain connection and intimacy amid technology – set up rules on phone use that you’re both comfortable with


Make your marriage a place of peace – take the time after work to decompress (don’t dump your work stress on your spouse). Build time to unwind into your schedules.

Establishing a sense of we-ness or solidarity – The spouse should always side with their husband/wife over in-laws/family

Don’t do anything to disrespect or dishonor your parents, or compromise who you are, but you must stand with your spouse when you are in the middle. Additionally, never tolerate any contempt toward your spouse.







Balancing the freedom and empowerment money represents with the security and trust it also symbolizes. Money buys pleasure but it also buys security


You have to do some clear-headed budgeting and work as a team on financial issues. Express concerns, needs, and fantasies.


Step 1 – itemize current expenses (food, rent, utilities, etc.)

Step 2 – manage everyday finances (decide and compromise on what’s essential)

Step 3 – plan your financial future. Imagine your life 5, 10, 20 years in the future and decide some financial goals together. Think about what you most desire and what you most fear. Share your lists and compromise on what’s important. Work as a team and devise a plan together.


Creating a sense of fairness and teamwork with housework. Usually the woman cares more about the cleanliness of their home (there are exceptions of course). Men don’t realize how important it is to them. When they leave the place a mess, the other spouse often feels disrespected and unsupported. To fix this, again, sit down and go over who is responsible for what chore. Make a list and do the chores without having to be asked by your spouse.



The mother’s purpose and meaning in life may change and often the husband is left behind. The husband must also make this transformation and follow his wife into this new realm. If he doesn’t go through the change with her, he will resent the child for taking his wife away. Focus on your marital friendship, don’t exclude dad from baby care, let dad be baby’s playmate, carve out time for the two of you, be sensitive to dad’s needs, and give mom a break.


Sex – fundamental appreciation and acceptance of each other. Make sex a priority in your marriage. Make time to talk about it and to have one on one time together. Talk about your sexual needs and ensure your partner can do the same while also feeling safe. When you talk about it, be gentle and positive (no criticism), be patient with each other, don’t take anything personally, and compromise. Talk about what felt good last time and what you need to make sex better. Enjoy the whole process (not just the big O). Lastly, learn to initiate sex and how to refuse it gently.

 You can have an agreed upon ritual with your spouse – for example ask your partner how amorous they are feeling from 1-9. There are many other ways to initiate, so come up with your own (from simply asking to lighting candles)



If you’re not in the mood, let your partner down softly. For example, “I’m sorry honey, but it’s not the right time for lovemaking for me. But I still love you a lot, and you are very attractive.” So, what about the flip side? How do you cope with a no? There cannot be any negative consequences when a partner says no. If you complain or sulk about it, you’re less likely to get it in the future.

> Counter-intuitive as it sounds, husbands who reward _(expressing they understand or asking what they want to do instead)_ their wives for saying no will end up having a lot more sex.

## Overcoming Gridlock**

What do you do about those perpetual problems you cannot overcome in a marriage? Couples know these issues will never go away, but they keep it from overwhelming their marriage. It’s critical to learn how to discuss these issues without hurting each other.

**Gridlock is always a sign of dreams for your life that your partner isn’t aware of, doesn’t respect, or hasn’t acknowledged.**

You can both pursue your dreams, and although there may be compromise at times, no one has to give up their dreams outright.





When you bury a dream, it just resurfaces in disguised form – as a gridlocked conflict

Keep working on your unsolvable conflicts. Couples who are demanding of their marriage are more likely to have deeply satisfying unions than those who lower their expectations.

1 – Explore your dreams – explain them to your partner, where they come from, and why they are so important to you. Talk honestly if you’re sharing and suspend judgment if you’re listening to your partner’s dreams. Tell your partner that you support their dream, express understanding, and be interested in learning more about it.

2 – Soothe – pay attention to how each of you are reacting to the conversation. Take a break if needed.

3 – Reach a temporary compromise – find common ground. This will help defang the issue. Explain non-negotiable areas as well as areas of flexibility. You may have to alter the timelines on your dreams, but come up with something you’re both comfortable with… something that honors both of your dreams.

> Don’t expect this to solve the problem, only to help you both live with it peacefully.
> 
> Rather than seeing each other’s dreams as threats, see them for what they are: deep desires held by someone we love.

4 – Say thank you! These can be stressful topics to cover, so thank you partner for having the patience to discuss them with you. Tell them three things you appreciate about them.

**you should be able to discuss perpetual problems with more love and joy rather than anger and frustration**

## **Create shared meaning**

 Create rituals of connection that are meaningful and intentional –



Support for each other’s roles.
When you both have similar expectations of what you and your partner’s roles are, your marriage will thrive



Shared goals
Write a mission statement for your life,


Shared values and symbols.

Symbols often reflect family values. Does your family have a set list of values they live by?







Putting 6 hours a week into your marriage is what it takes to make it thrive. Here is how to get the best bang for your buck:




-   Partings – learn one thing that is happening in your spouse’s life that day (daily).
-   Reunions – hug and kiss your partner for at least 6 seconds when you get home. Have a stress reducing conversation at the end of the day (20 minutes).
-   Admiration and appreciation – communicate genuine affection and appreciation toward your spouse.
-   Affection – Give physical affection when you’re together during the day and especially before you go to bed at night.
-   Weekly date – once a week go out for a 2 hour date and update your love maps. Get to know each other and what’s going on in your lives.
-   State of the union meeting – once a week, make time to sit down and talk about what went right in your relationship this week. Express some things you appreciate about them this week. Also, discuss issues that may have arisen. At the end, ask what you can do to make them feel loved in the coming week.


Criticism comes from 2 sources. First, an emotionally unresponsive spouse. Criticism will drive a partner away, so do your best to turn toward them (principle 3). They will have to turn toward you as well. The other source of criticism is yourself. It’s connected to self-doubt.




> If you consider yourself inadequate, you are always on the lookout for what is not there in yourself and in your partner.




Forgive yourself for all your flaws and accept yourself despite all of your imperfections. **Focus on what you’re grateful for instead of what’s missing**.
