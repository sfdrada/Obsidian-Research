Men can achieve multiple orgasms by delaying and even withholding ejaculation
- orgasm != ejaculation
- [[Alfred Kinsey]] pioneering sex researcher
- ejaculation/getting off < love making

"In my normal, everyday sort of ejaculation my pleasure is quickly over with. Not so in multiple orgasms. There seems to be no final peak to this pleasure, either. The practice offers the added bonus of affording extra energy, so I am just never tired. Now I can have as much sex as I want and I can control it rather than have it control me."



experiencing multiple orgasms without ejaculating can also help men achieve their bodies optimum health and even live longer.

[[Sexual Kung Fu]]

Sperms is very expensive and important

Theory without practice is worthless

Avg Time Till Mastery: 3-6 months

Research contradicts teh belief that mens sexuality peaks in teens and declines overtime

To become multi orgasmic, you must learn the ability too separate the different sensations of arousal and to revel in orgasm without cresting over into ejaculation.

## Brainwaves & Reflexes

Orgasms share characteristics like rythmic body movements, increased heart rate, muscle tension, sudden release of tesnion, elevated blood pressure, and pelvic contractions

Brain-wave research reveals orgasms may occur primarily in the brain. 
- psychology > physical stimulation

Orgasm: A peak emotional and physical experience
Ejaculation: A reflex that occurs at the base of teh spine and results of the ejection of semen.

**You can learn to experience the peak feeling of orgasm without triggering the reflex of ejaculation**


## Prove It



![[Arousal Chart.PNG]]

The arousal charts for multi-orgasmic men was identical to women

The average orgasms for a multi orgasmic man: 4
- Taoist sexuality is about satisfaction and cultivation, not score


When you become multi-orgasmic, you will never have to worry about how long you can last or how many orgasms your partner has, because you both will  be able to have all the orgasms you could ever want.


## The Little Death

"After ejaculating, a man is tired, his ears buzz, his eyes are heavy, and he longs for sleep. He is thirsty and his limbs feel weak and stiff. In ejaculating he enjoys a brief moment of sensation but then suffers long hours of exhaustion."
- Athletes & rockstars abstain before performance


"I really notice it in the morning if I ejaculate. I get up dragging my feet and I am tried by noon. When I have multiple orgasms without ejaculating, I wake up refreshed and I need less sleep."


The multi-orgasmic nematodes that were allowed to mate at will live over 50% longer than normal sexual habits
- The genes and biological processes of nematodes are the same as mammals.

"If a man has intercourse without spilling his seed, his vital essence is strengthened."

All of the organs and glands in your body give their best energy to create semen. 
- Many plants and animals deteriorate after their seed has been released



# Know Thyself





**Exploring your body and understanding your arousal rate are essential to becoming multi-orgasmic. The best partners are aware of both their own and their partners desires.**


## Your Body

### Penis 

There are no bones or muscles in the penis, it is primarily spongy tissue. 
- 2-3 inches of the penis are rooted inside the body in the pubococcygeus muscle (PC muscle). 
	- We we can strengthen this muscle for stronger erections, stronger orgasms, and better ejaculatory control.

The size of your erection is much less important than its strength and what you do with it.

### Testicles

Sperm is produced in their testicles and normal body temperature is too hot for sperm production.
- Tight underwear that keeps your testicles close to your body lowers your sperm count

Testicles are pulled into your body as they prepare to ejaculate.
- Pulling them down and away from the body postpones ejaculation

![[Mans Sexual Anatomy.PNG]]



### Prostate

Semen secretions from your prostate are 1/3 of your ejaculate.

The prostate is a gland that lies at the center of your pelvis, just behind the pubic bone, and just above the perineum.
- You can help keep your prostate healthjy and possible reduce ypur risk fo prostate cancer by doing pelvis Sexual Kung Fu Exercises and massaging the prostate regularly

The prostate, like the G spot for women, is often highly sensitive to sexual stimulation.
- The male G spot

"In men there is an orgasm triggered by the penis and one by the prostate."
- Different physically & emotionally
	- The difference between a clitoral and vaginal orgasm

The prostate becomes increasingly sensitive to erotic stimulation as the man becomes aroused and approaches orgasm.
- The body becomes engorged from front to back so partners tshould wait until a man is highly aroused before attemptring prsotate stimulation.

You can stimulate your prostate externally through your pereniumm at your Million-Dollar-Point or more directly through your anus. 
- The best position is lying on your back so you can insert a lubricated finger, curl it forward, and touch your prostate to feel a bump the size of a walnut 1-2 inches on the front wall of your rectum. 
	- Gently rub back and forth
	- you can also thrust in and out at different speeds
	- You can also stimulate the anal sphincter and perenium
- When prostate stimulation brings you to ejaculation, the fluid flows rather than spurts.
	- Very deep and intense stimulation and harder to control
		- Go slowly 

### Perineum

"The Gate Of Life & Death"
- The role of preventing ejaculation
	- On the perenium just infront of the anus
		- The Million Dollar Point



### Sex Muscles

The pubococcygeus: The muscles from your pubic bone to your tailbone
- Basis of sexual health and multi orgasm

The penis withdraws into the body if it is not used regularly
- It is important to exercise your sexual organs

### Anus

High nerve endings and close to prostate
- clean your anus and what touches it before use
	- Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a practice

### Nipples

Underrated and underexplored pleasure.



## Your Energy

### The Body Electric

Chinese medicine is based on a person's ability to maintain athe proper circulation of bioelectric enrgy (chi) through the body.

![[Microcosmic Orbit.PNG]]




### Your Microcosmic Orbit

Bioelectric energy in every cell of your body.

Meridian - well defined circuit your energy travels along
- acupuncture

"I think of the Microcosmic Orbit as a channel or meidian or route that has been discovered and tested over thousands of years to transform the raw biological energy used to create children into a lighter and more refined energy that can beused to improve one's health and lovemaking."


### The Back Channel

Begins at the perineum and runs from the tip of the tailbone, up the spine and neck, to the crown of the head, and down to the forehead ending between the bottom of the nose and upper lip.


### The Front Channel

Runs from the tip of the tongue to your throat along the midline down to the pubis and perenium
- Youch the tongue to your palate closes the Microcosmic Orbit.


#### What does energy feel like when it moves?
- warmth
- tingling
- prickling
- pulsating
- humming
- bubbling
- buzzing
- fast/slow
- path/points

#### How does chi move?
"The mind moves and the chi follows"
- focus your attention on specific areas
	- the stronger the focus the greater the movement
	- Not pushing or pulling, just shift focus


### Sexual Energy

Ching chi (sexual energy) is the most powerful bioelectric energy.
- Learn to draw the sexual energy out of genitals and circulate it through the body.
	- Master multi & whole body orgasms


Since we are concieved through orgasm and orgasmic energy permeates every cell of our body, to stay healthy and active we need to feel this rejuvenating, orgasmic energy regularly
- Ideally every day


"Sexual energy is available to men 24 hours a day, but most men starve themselves because they believe they can satisfy themselves sexually only during a few minutes of intercourse. The most liberating thing for men is to discover that they ahve total access to and control over their sexual energy at any time."

Men and women have sexual urges that need to be acted on or channelled in some way.
- The West tries to suppress or sublimate this desire
	- Leads to physical and psychological imbalances

Practicing self-cultivation will result in controllable sexual urges with an energetic and calm sense of well-being.

"Before I started practicing Sexual Kung Fu, if I had not ejaculated in a while, my sexual urge would get stronger and stronger... after ejaculating, this urge would dissappear almost instantly aand I couldn't nderstand why I had spent so much time and money trying to satisfy it. I would tell myself that I wouldn't do it next time, but I knew after a while the sexual urge would return and I would do it all over again. When I finally started practicing Sexual Kung Fu, my sexual energy was still strong, but balanced. It was the first time in my life I was happy to be a man sexually, because I finally had control over my sexual energy."

AS you practice, you may have more sexual energy than you are used to, and you will need to learn to channel this excess energy.

"When I started the practice, all of my relationships became sexualized. I needed to learn to circulate and balance the nergy"
- The Cool Draw transforms the energy into more neutral and less volatile phyusical energy.
- Tai Chi/Chi Kung to ground energy
- Exercise to manage energy

## Your Arousal

We need to feel aroused to feel the l;ife giving foce of sexual energy every day
- Our body produces more sexual hormones = fountain of youth
	- When you learn to circulate your sexual energy, you can feel this rejuvenating power at any time.

### Becoming Aware Of Your Arousal

Become aware of the speed of your arousal.

When you start to get sexually aroused, your penis increases in length and width as it fills wth blood. Erect is when the valve closes down in the veins sttopping blood from returning to the body. 

"The wisdom of the penis"
- Something needs to be addressed in the relationship/your life before you are able to get it up with your partner

There is no such thing as "impotence"
- use the solo exercices [Chapter 8]
- soft entry technique


### Stages Of Erection

The Four Attainments:
1. Firmness/Lengthening
2. Swelling
3. Hardness
4. Heat

"In the first stage, your penis starts to move and become erect. In the second stage, it's firm, but not hard (Soft entry technique). In the third stage, it is erect and hard. In the fourth stage, it is stiff and really hot. This last stage is also when your testicles draw into your body. It is much easier to avoid ejaculating when you can remain in the erect and hard third stage. Pulling the sexual energy up helps keep the penis frm getting to the final, stiff and hot stage. Relaxing is also essential, as is trying to be aware of when you move into that anxious, explosive fourth stage when ejaculation is imminent."

### The Secret Of May Sexuality

Staying Power - Generally achieved by distracting ourselves from arousal rather than learning to sensitize to it. 
- True ejaculatory control comes frmo knowing your individual arousal rate, not ignoring it.
	- Learn to feel your rising pleasure more

#### But isn't sex supposed to be about relaxing and letting go?

Knowing when to let go fo our sexuality and when to control it is the essence of Sexual Kung Fu, and the secret to male sexuality.


## Your Ejaculation



Contractile/Emission phase: Prostate contracts & empties semen into urethra.

Expulsion phase: Semen propelled down urethra and out penis.

Pleasure pelvic contraxctions (contractile phase) is a popping/fluttering sensation in the prostate.
- Multiorgasmic men do this without ejaculating


Preseminal fluid comes from the prostate and cowper's gland.
- Contains sperm so make sure you use birth control

#### Where does the semen go when I don't ejaculate?

Broken down and reabsorbed.
- If you get a vasectomy, practice the testicle massage and circulate sexual energy

There are no negative side effects to not ejaculating


Retrograde ejaculation: Loss of erection but no ejaculation -semen goes in your bladder and you pee it out. 
- When checking, cloudy pee = retrograde

## Your Orgasm
The male orgasm lies on the precipice of ejaculation.
- Do not rush over the edge
	- Bottom of the arousal slope

After you experience prolonged and ecstatic sexual multi orgasms, ejaculation is dissapointing.

![[Orgasmic Potential.PNG]]

#### How to experience multi orgasm
1. Get sexually aroused
2. Get an eretion
3. Pass from excitement phase to contractile phase.
	1. During contractile phase you will feel pleasureable prostae contractions lasting 3-5 seconds
4. Stop/Decrease stimulation momentarily to regain control of arousal rate.
	1. Squeeze PC muscle to maintain control
	2. Pull Balls down & away
	3. Cover top of penis
	4. "I Am redirecting my energy upwards"

With multiple orgasms, your arousal is like a wave that rises to a peak and then, instead of crresting over and crashing, is swept up by a larger wave and on to an even higher peak. 

Do not strive for contracticle phase orgasms
=

Falling backward into nonejaculatory orgasm > falling forward into ejaculation


If your partner is multi-orgasmic, you will not have to worry about giving your partner her orgasms and then getting your orgasm. You both have the potential for multiple peaks of orgasm pleasurte.

If you are having difficulty separating your ogasm from your jeaculationm you can being drawing the srexual energy up your spine before you orgasm. 
- The real key to whole body pleasure and healing si the circlation of sexual energy through the microcosmic orbit.
	- Orgasmic feeling in other parts of your body

Don't get frustrated or dissapointed if you fail, that's part of the learning process.



#### Multiple orgasms vs. whole body orgasms

Several pelvic non ejaculatory orgagams are extremely satisfying and energizing but the real secret is to spread those orgasms throughout your body.
- Draw up your sexual energy up the spine, into your brain, and throughout the entire body

The experience of a whole body orgasm is so intense people resort to mystical phrases. 

"You can have an orgasmic pulsation in teh whole body or in any part of the body. One of your organs can hve an orgasm. Your brain can have an orgasm. You wouldn't know you are having an orgasm in your penis or in your prostate unless your brain was having an orgasm too."


It's hard to know when one whole body orgasm ends and another begins. 
- Discrete  multiple orgams, you have a peak orgasmic experience and then the orgasm subsides, but it is then followed by another discrete orgasm
- Continuous multiple orgasms, you have a peak orgasmic experience that may grow more or less intense, but you never leave the orgasmic state entirely

You can feel your energy enter your partner and hers circulate through you. You can feel physical boundaries dissolve and oneness with the partner or the universe during lovemaking. 
- Can result in a transformation of consciousness






# Chapter 3 - Becoming A Multi-Orgasmic Man





## Breathing Basics

The breath is the gate through which you can gain control of your body. 
- quick & shallow breathing = fast heart rate
- slow & deep breathing = slow heart rate
	- Reduces probability of ejaculation

### Belly Breathing

Shallow Breathing: Breathing into our chest and shoulders = less oxygen absorption
- Anxiety & stress promotes breathing style

Belly Breathing: Breathing deeply from the bottom of our lungs. 
- Replaces stagnant air at the bottom of lungs with oxygen
- Healthiest way to breathe

1. Sit on a chair with back straight and feet touching floor  shoulder width apart.
2. Place hands over navel and relax shoulders. 
3. Inhale through nose and feel lower abdomen expand.
4. Keeping chest relaxed, exhale with some force to pull the lower abdomen back in, like pulling your navel back toward your spine. Also feel your penis and testicles pull up.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 eighteen to thirty-six times.

![[Belly Breathing.png]]

### Nose Breathing
- warm filtered air
- preferable way to exhale

### Mouth Breathing
- cold unfiltered air = harder to consume



**A few minutes of belly breathing each day will teach your body to breathe deeply on its own, even when you are asleep

Essential to stopping ejaculation and feeling whole body orgasms.
- circulates and absorbs sexual energy into organs
- Massages organs & prostate
- Relieves full feeling after session


### Belly Laughing

The kind of laugh that makes your whole belly shake.
- genuine
- relaxes diaphragm
- generates a lot of energy
- 


### Century Count
1. Slowly inhale (expanding your belly) and exhale (flattening your belly). Count each complete inhalation and exhalation as one breath.
2. Continue breathing from the belly and counting from one to one hundred, thinking only about your breathing. 
3. If you notice that your mind has strayed, start again. 
4. Practice this exercise twice a day until you can count to one hundred with ease.



## Strengthening Your Sex Muscles

![[The PC Muscles.png]]


The pubococcygeus muscle, or pc muscle, which we mentioned in the last chapter, is the muscular sling that stretches from the pubic bone in the front to the tailbone in the back
- Felt just behind their testicles and in front of their anus
- muscle you use to stop yourself from urinating
- muscle when you are pushing out those last few drops of urine.
- rhythmic contractions in your pelvis and anus during orgasm
- Build muscle strength to prevent ejaculation
	- Orgasm builds from prostate
- prevent hardening and swelling of the prostate and help avoid or heal prostate problems
- Pc muslce surrounds the prostate gland


Women who have developed strong pc muscles can hold a man’s penis in their vagina more tightly


the urinary duct, the ejaculatory duct, and the seminal-vesicle duct all pass through the prostate. (This is why when a man’s prostate is enlarged, he has problems urinating and ejaculating.)



Urinate before self-pleasuring/lovemaking
- Makes you feel like you need to ejaculate & harder to prevent

Pulling up on your perineum as you push out the urine will help you urinate with more force and will help strengthen your kidneys, prostate gland, and bladder in addition to your pc muscle.
- standing on your toes and clenching your teeth will help intensify your practice
- squeezing the muscles around your eyes and mouth, you can increase the force

### PC Pull-Ups
1. Inhale and concentrate on your prostate, perineum, and anus.
2. As you exhale, contract your pc muscle around your prostate and around your anus while at the same time contracting the muscles around your eyes and mouth. 
3. Inhale and relax, releasing your pc, eye, and mouth muscles. 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, contracting your muscles as you exhale and releasing them as you inhale, nine to thirty-six times.


**Consistency is more important than quantity.
- Connect do a daily routine
- raise and lower a towel on erect penis






## Self-Pleasuring & Self-Cultivation

guilt and embarrassment about masturbating
- Christianity’s prohibition of masturbation, which at one time was called onanism, is based on a misreading of the biblical story of Onan. Onan was punished for refusing to impregnate the wife of his dead brother, as was the custom at the time. His “sin” had nothing to do with masturbation.

According to the Tao, play is one of the best ways to learn

Many people worry about masturbating “too much,” but the Taoists knew that there is no such thing—as long as one learns to control ejaculation


“screwing your brains out” is an accurate description of the stupor that occurs after repeated ejaculation.

Estimates suggest that about 70 percent of married men—and married women—pleasure themselves
- A recent national sex study sponsored by the University of Chicago found that people who are having sex regularly with a partner actually pleasure themselves more than people who are not




### Experience Your Own Pleasure

Pornography, though it can increase your sexual energy, is also distracting and can make it difficult for you to focus on your own sensations as you approach orgasm
- focus on your sensations > visuals
- you need to go inward and experience your own pleasure, not someone else’s idea of pleasure.

![[Penis Reflexology.png]]
*the different parts of the penis correspond to different parts of the body*
- rub all parts


### Touch Your Balls

The testicles can be especially sensitive to light touch, although many men also enjoy pulling on their scrotum.
- increases the production of testosterone
	- raising your sperm count and by improving your overall health

### Explore The Million Dollar Point

your perineum and the Million-Dollar Point (just in front of your anus). Pushing on this spot when you are about to ejaculate can help stop the ejaculatory reflex, but again, for now you are just exploring it for its pleasure. Pushing on this spot can squeeze more blood into your penis, which will make it throb pleasurably. Strong rhythmic pressure here also imitates the prostate contractions that accompany contractile-phase orgasm.
- best stimulated after you have an erection and are highly aroused
	- Body swells front to back

### Take Time
enjoy and learn to prolong ejaculation.

"If a man can learn to go for fifteen to twenty minutes during masturbation or pleasuring, he can go as long as he wants to during intercourse. That period (fifteen to twenty minutes) seems to be critical. Once you’ve passed it, you have control. It’s that simple.”


“When I used to play with myself, I would jack off in three to five minutes just to release tension or because I was bored or whatever. Selfcultivation is different. I try to play with myself as long as I can and not come. After a while, I could play with myself for twenty minutes.”

If you start to feel bored, ask yourself what is causing the boredom.
- set the mood of the room
- Touch and feel your hands and arms, your feet (if you can reach them), calves, and thighs. Touch your chest and even your nipples. When you pleasure yourself, try massaging your thighs and stomach before you zero in on your genitals.
- sit in front of a mirror

### Cultivate Love

Cultivating self-love is essential to being a loving partner. Sexual energy simply magnifies the energy in your body, positive or negative. 
- Cultivating your sexual energy into loving-kindness will also help you not to ejaculate


you cannot separate your genitals from your heart because the sexual energy circulates throughout your entire body

“I used to actually want to keep sex and emotions separate, but as I practiced Taoist sexuality, my genitals became more connected to my heart and I discovered real, profound love for my partner and even for other people.”
- Put your right hand on your groin and your left hand on your heart, connecting sexual energy with love. If you often feel anger, hatred, or other negative emotions, you must transform these feelings before cultivating your sexual energy

Self Love != Egoism or Narcicism

Drawing the sexual energy away from your pelvis and massaging your pelvis will help decrease the pressure


### Self-Pleasuring
1. Start by lubricating your penis. Lubricant will increase your sensations. Oil is generally better than lotion, which dries up more quickly.
2. Pleasure yourself however you like, remembering to massage and stimulate your entire penis, your scrotum, and your perineum, including the Million-Dollar Point.
3. Try to notice your increasing levels of arousal: notice the tingling at the root of your penis, notice the stages of erection, notice your heartbeat rise.
4. When you are getting near ejaculation, stop and rest. Try to notice the contraction of your pc muscle and anus that occurs at contractile-phase orgasm, although don’t be surprised if it takes some time to experience this without ejaculating. You can also try to squeeze your pc muscle around your prostate if the prostate starts contracting and you are afraid you might fall over the edge.
5. After you regain control, you can start again as many times as you like and continue for as long as you like.


## Learning To Control Ejaculation

The more you practice the exercises you’ve learned so far, the easier it will be to practice the ones given later in this chapter and stop yourself from going past the “point of no return.”



### Stopping

Start/Stop Technique: Stay aware of your arousal rate and stop a few strokes (or thrusts, if you’re with your partner) before you think you will ejaculate.


### Breathing

Breathe in deeply and hold your breath for several moments until the urge to ejaculate subsides.
- Some multi-orgasmic men, however, breathe rapidly to delay ejaculation
	- Breath Of Fire: Deep, slow breathing helps control your sexual energy, whereas shallow, rapid breathing helps disperse the energy.


### Contracting PC Muscle

By learning to squeeze your prostate during contractile-phase orgasm, you can help yourself avoid moving from contraction to expulsion (Point Of No Return)


### Squeezing The Penis

place the first two fingers of either hand on the underside of your penis, place your thumb on the top, and squeeze
- Some men also find that gripping their penis like the handlebar of a bicycle and pressing down on the tip or underside with their thumb helps them reduce their arousal
	- you can try using your mind to help squeeze the tip of your penis instead of pulling out during intercourse
- Another good technique is squeezing at the base of your penis (remembering to also squeeze with your mind). This will help you control your arousal and will also expand and strengthen your erections

![[Delaying Ejaculation With The Squeezing Method.png]]


![[Scrotal Tug.png]]





### Pressing The Million-Dollar Point

helps delay ejaculation both by focusing your attention and by interrupting the ejaculatory reflex
- Simple & effective
- Decreases erection slightly but ejaculation greatly
- Can use during intercourse without withdrawing
	- Look into Sexual Kung Fu warning about this spot
![[Mans Sexual Anatomy.PNG]]

There should be an indentation when you push at the correct spot. You will need to push your finger in up to your first joint



### Scrotal Tugging

your testicles have to pull up close to the body in order to propel the semen out of the testes
- Delays & prevents ejaculation


### Drawing Away Sexual Energy

the secret to stopping yourself from ejaculating is learning to pump your sexual energy away from your genitals and up through your spine to the rest of your body. 
- If the sexual energy continues to build up in your groin, it will eventually be too great to control and will shoot out

simply imagine drawing your sexual energy out of your penis, past your perineum, and up your spine
- Contracting your perineum will help pump the energy up and will prepare you for the Big Draw



### Separating Orgasm From Ejaculation
1. Start by lubricating your penis, as you did in the Self-Pleasuring exercise.
2. Before focusing on your genitals, remember to touch and massage the rest of your body, especially your belly, thighs, and nipples.
3. Self-pleasure however you like, remembering to stimulate your entire penis, your scrotum, and your perineum.
4. Pay close attention to your arousal rate. Once again, try to notice your increasing levels of arousal: notice the tingling at the root of your penis, notice the stages of erection, notice your breathing change and your heartbeat rise.
5. As you feel yourself getting close to the point of no return, stop, breathe, and lightly contract your pc muscle around your prostate. 
   - You also can delay your ejaculation
      - Million-Dollar Point
      - The scrotal tug
      - Pressing on the tip of your penis
      - Using your mind to squeeze the tip of your penis.
6. If you feel that your sexual energy is getting too wild and difficult to control, try to draw this energy up your spine with your mind, and squeeze and release your pc muscle several times. If you are still feeling too hot and out of control, stop for ten or twenty seconds and focus on deep breathing.
6. Try to notice the contraction of your pc muscle and anus that occurs at contractile-phase orgasm.
7. After you have peaked several times without ejaculating, stop. You will feel peaceful and/or energized afterward. Try to notice your sexual energy circulating in your body, which you will feel as a tingling, itching, or prickling.

"[1] Variation seems to help, not doing the same over and over again—varying the depth of the thrust when I am making love, or using different strokes when it’s just me and my hand. [2] Slowing down when I feel close to the edge. [3] Deep-breathing exercises. And [4] moving the accumulated chi up my spine and through the Microcosmic Orbit."


**The most important parts of the practice are breathing, squeezing your pc muscle, and learning to relax into a nonejaculatory orgasm



### Pelvic Pleasure

Natural result of the increased blood and chi that have been pumped to the area and your increased sexual energy
- If the pressure feels uncomfortable, you can:
	- Ejaculate
	- use deep breathing
	- PC Pull-Ups
	- The Finger Lock
	- Perineum massage






## Learning To Control Your Sexual Energy

it is much easier for you to work with your sexual energy when it is still “cool,” and we therefore strongly encourage you to learn this exercise before attempting the Big Draw.
- If you learn to do the Cool Draw successfully, you will rarely need to use the Big Draw
- The earlier you are able to draw the sexual energy away from your genitals, the easier it will be for you to multiply and experience whole-body orgasms and, eventually, use your sexual energy for health and healing.

Cool Draw will allow you to decrease the urge to ejaculate
- the quickest and safest way for men to relieve feelings of sexual frustration and horniness as well as to increase the flow of creative energy to their heart and brain
![[Drawing The Energy Up To The Crown Of Your Head.png]]




## Cool Draw

The Cool Draw is also called testicle breathing, because the technique causes your testicles to rise and fall as if they were breathing.
- you are using your mind and muscles to raise and lower your testicles and to draw sexual energy out of your genitals and up to your brain
- Your testicles are the factories of your sexual hormones and sexual energy
- You will be able to feel this orgasmic wave of pleasure at any time without even having to be sexually aroused.

### The Cool Draw

1. Touch or cup your testicles with one hand to warm them up until you feel a slight tingling or the first stirring of your sexual energy. (If you are in a public place, you can simply think a sexual thought or fantasy.) 
2. Inhale and gently pull up on the muscles around the testicles, the perineum, and the anus. As you inhale and pull your muscles up, imagine that you are sipping this sexual energy and drawing it from your testicles to your perineum and on to your anus and tailbone.
3. Exhale and relax your muscles, but keep your attention on your rising sexual energy.
4. Continue to inhale and pull up and then exhale and relax several more times until you can feel a warm or tingling sensation at your perineum. Once you are able to move this sexual energy, you can simply begin using the spine like a straw, sipping the energy from your testicles and perineum right up the entire length of your spine to the base of your skull. (Gently tucking your chin in will help the energy move from your spine into your head.) Do this for five to ten minutes or until you become aware of a light or tingling feeling in your head. With your mind, try to circle the energy in your head.
5. Finally, touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth half an inch behind your front teeth where the palate curves down (see figure 11). Your tongue works like a light switch that connects your front and back channels, allowing the energy to flow down the front of your body to your navel.


As long as you feel the energy reach your brain, you will know that you have successfully performed the exercise



###  Loosening Up
If your back or pelvis is tight, it will be difficult for you to draw sexual energy up through your spine. It is important for you to loosen up your pelvic area, spinal column, and neck. Imagine that you are sitting on a galloping horse, and rock your pelvis back and forth, letting your chin bob up and down. Your spinal cord should rock like a wave.



### Drawing The Energy Down


In addition to drawing sexual energy from the genitals up to the brain along the Back Channel, it is also essential for you to bring the energy down along the Front Channel to your belly, where it can be safely stored
- Men find it easier to draw up the back and harder down the front
- Women find it easier to draw down the front and harder down the back

![[Touching The Tongue To Your Palette.png]]

Although each step helps move the energy up, contracting your anus is the most  important  part  of  the  practice  because  it  is  this  squeezing  action  that literally pumps the energy up your spine

The navel is our physical and energetic center
- an energetic reservoir where you can safely store the energy you have generated.
	- Body can "digest" when needed



if you are not able to raise the sexual energy all the way to the head at first, you can raise it up along your spine to your abdomen and channel it directly into this reservoir at your navel



#### I don't feel my sexual energy

Unaroused sexual energy is easy to draw up and easy for your body to digestbecause it is not too hot. However, if you cannot feel enough sexual energyby simply touching your testicles or thinking a sexual thought, you canstimulate your genitals more directly.


#### I can't raise the energy up my spine

Your cerebrospinal fluid bathes the brain and spine. Pumps at your sacrum (the back of your pelvis) and the base of your skull help this fluid circulate and can also help you draw energy up your spine


1. Activate your sacral pump by squeezing your anus up toward the tailbone and rocking your pelvis back and forth.
2. Activate your cranial pump (at the base of your skull) by drawing your chin in and up and then back out in a soft gentle circle. Keep the jaw and neck muscles relaxed.
3. After activating the sacral and cranial pumps, rest and begin drawing the energy up your spine into your brain. Looking up with your eyes toward the top of your head will also help direct the energy up to the crown of your head. Repeatedly activate these pumps until you feel the energy move up.

#### I can't bring the energy down

  
1. Swirl your tongue around your mouth, which will activate your salivary glands.
2. Once you have a large pool of saliva, draw the sexual energy now in your brain into the saliva by focusing on the saliva. (Energy Flows Where The Mind Goes)
3. Swallow this pool of saliva in one gulp and follow it with your mind as it flows down your esophagus and into your stomach. 
4. Repeat this swallowing and imagine the energy collecting in a pool at your stomach.
5. with both hands stroke the front of your body from your throat straight down to your belly.

## Opening Blocks In Your Front Channel

Most people today carry around a great deal of physical and emotional tension. 
- tightness in back/chest
- Men in particular are prone to holding in their emotions, which often can lead to energetic blockages in the Front Channel, along which emotions are stored—that is, in your heart, solar plexus, stomach, and intestines.
	- It is essential you open these blockages before attempting the big draw


1. Put your left hand on your belly and put your right hand at the base of your throat just above your heart center.
2. Imagine as you inhale that you are drawing energy up the Front Channel to your right hand and from there up your throat to the tip of your tongue.
3. As you exhale, imagine you are reversing the flow so it descends backdown past your heart to your belly. This will help open any energy blocks in your Front Channel.
