# The Tracking Journal



# Chapter 1 - Introduction



**The more energy you can put into meaningful projects, the quicker you will achieve your goals**

Journals are deisgned to make your life easier not harder

Holistic life apporah = happy and goal oriented

"Life is what happens to you while your busy making other plans" -John Lennon

If (Trigger) Do (Action)
- Use rules to automate decisions
	- Sucessful people have rules for everything
		- The have too many decisions to make everyday

High level rule -> decision > !decision
Low level rule -> doing this would help

**If you know you have to make certaind ecisions at some point in your life, figure out rules for them now. The weorst moment to make an important decision is when it surprises you**

The simpler the rule, the better
- freedom in rules

## Personality Faders
**If you want to become someone else you have to change your modus operandi**

Always initial resistance

Personality is NOT binary
- you can control & responsibility over your feelings fader

Nothing meaningful happens in the comfort zone. 
- The necessary evil of confronting your fears


Bold decisions, meticulous self-tracking and minimization

Coming to terms with who you are and how you want to live your life is the foundation of evrything


## The Four Archetypes

Build an well-oiled machine, then run it and let it go

### Runner
A broken engine that's running
- most people

No real clue what they are doing but working hard.
- Fails because they don't set rules for themselves
- Dont plan ahead
	- Running in circles

### Preppers
A well-oiled machine that isnt running

Tend to voeranalyze and overthink irrelevant detaisl
- Collect informatron to feel in control
	- theory only gets you so far w/o action
- They fail because no action
- Intellectuals mainly suffer from this



### Spinner
A broken engine that isn't running

Their life consists of reactiosn toexternal impulses, which leads to a life without any sens eof control and this often results in low self estyeem and depression
- Car on ice spinning and not moving


### Rider
A well-oiled engine that is running smoothly

It's easy to tell the people in this category apart frmo others.

Zero cognitive dissonace between what htey beluieve and how they act
* they lead by example
* The runner acts because he wants ot get somewhere and the rider does it because that's who he is


Consider your fears that keep you frmo pursuiong this way of living
- if your fears are holding oytu back, take some time toa sk yourself whehther oyuw ant to lvie your lfie to be determined by love or fear/ Realize that everyone is scared


Not doing aything on the other hand means giving in to your fears. and givcing in to your freas is a one-way street right into depression



Visualize target you

Who you want to be is a choice you make, not once, but eveyr day of your life. Atomic Habits is the idea sthat everya ction yo take is a vote you cast for your self-image

Autoamtion spirat, believing that you are a reider is in fact a self fulfilling prophecy. The more you believe it, the more you become it.



# Chapter 2 - Keeping Check




If you want to elarn something quickly you should spend some time makign that thing as much fun as possible.
- combine objects togetehr to boost their fun level

5 a day b day days and 1 weekly review

## Interval Training
Taking a 15 minute break every 50 minutes

Fatigue inhibits learnign so give yourself at least one day a weekw here tyou get to unwind
- Taking a break means avoiding taxing or stressful actions

## Eliminate Distrcations

Flow, you'll know how good it fdeeels to be fully immersed in an activity.


Immersion si where the magic happens. It's when you're in the zone, when you forget ot eat dirnk or sleep, when you are operating atht every peak of your existence
- Remove distractions to keep yourself in flow
- List all possible distractions and how you can mitigate them

In order to be successful in pursing my golas, I need to be a true minimalist, only focusing on what's actually improtant. THe mosgt important goals in life ar ethose that are NOT urgent


How do you want to spend your time and on what

On average, it takes us 25 minutes to return to the original task after an interruption

Accept that you are going to miss out on things 

Tell your friends and family that you should not be interrrupted during your working hours.
- there is a time for everythgin -> instead of being 20% there all of the time, you could be 100% there 20% of the time.

"Word hard, Play Hard"
- not work moderately hard while your thinking about playing and playing moderately hartd while you think about workign.


## Inward & Outward Focus

Oiling your machine (working on yourself) & pulling the lever (taking actions)

Habits arte short exercises or routines tha t you do regularly in order to make yourself feel better or learn something new.
- oiling


Projects are goals you work towarsd in order to:
1. Create something beautiful or cool
2. Show your owrk
3. Help others
	- Pulling the levver

Habits are there to help yourself, projects are there to help others



# Chapter 3 - Projects



**No matter how little money yuou have, make decisios as if money wasn't an issue


Do what is right, not what's easy

Learnt os pend your earnings ont he right thigns, and that's the things that get you closer to where you actually want to be. 
- Whaich investments get you closer to your big goals?


You can't plant trees if you're putting out fires
- Spending money on time wasting vs. spending money on investments and growth


I spend a lot of money on things that make my work easier and more fun
- If I know that it'll make my work easier and mroe fun that means it's an indirect source of income and it'll make its money back many times over

When I buy soemthing, it has to be something I'll actually use - something I know will work 
- return or sell otherwise

If financial wealth is all you care about, you'll make unhealthy decisions.


Money makes people selfihs, independent, and less helpful.


So how do we stop the infgluence of money on our lves? It's ofeten just a matter of picking a bettter motivator (ideally one that will make you money as a side effect)
- a good motivator shoud push you to do your very best work, not to sell out.

My entire company is built aroudn the idea that if you learned something frrom my free videos, you'll want the full courses, books and coaching as wlel.
- Focused on content, not appeal. The better i do as a teacher, the more courses I'll sell

I don't care if I lose a bit of short term money, I believ ethe long term will make up for it, not just financially, but emotionally.


## Creating Value

**Those who give the most recieve the most**

Money and fame are natural byproducts of success.

If you are helping others by providing value, they'll naturally want to pay you back and put you on a pedestal.
- people snense motivations and whether you're truly trying to help them

Make somethign so valuable that people couldn't turn it down if they tried.
- Put as much love and care into your work as you can.
	- "How can I make this even better?"

Creating value is a skill

Start by asking yourse;f what creating value means for your product. How can you improve the relationships your customer will have with your product?

evem of your techincally already finished, ask yoursle,f how can you make your work even better


Those who give the most, recieve the most. Crteat value for other s by offering your services, by connecting them with others, by sharing your knowledge and expertise. Spedn time with thema nd listen to wha they ahve to say. Be t he guy people come to whe they're in a bad mood and they need cheering up. FIgure out how yoiu lidfe to help adn become a master at it.

## Picking Projects
A project is a goal you work towars in order to:
1. create something beautiufl 
2. show you work
3. help others
- outward focus

Pick somethign you can get excited about
-

pretending you're someone you're not is a guarantee for failure. Make stuff you yourself would buy in a heartbeat. 

"Naive Research": Analyze what others are doing in your area and focus on how they or their producst make you feel
- what bothers you abut their approah?
- Where do you see room for improvement?
- Whaty excietes you?
	- Use these quiestions as guidelines for your own work
		- based on your perception than objective data


Write down your ideas, shape them into guidelines for your future projects
- keep refining overtime


#### What kind of value do you want to add to the world? 

#### In a few wrods, what are your projects to create these values


#### What will motivate you aboute these projects when times are tough? How do you know you should keep gpomg. even if you're not having any success wit it? Positive motivators are love, frinedship, family, intelligence, happiness, healthy, healping others, doing what's right or spirituality.


#### What kind of person will go bananas over your projects? What kind of person will absolutely hate them?



#### How do these projects create value for your fans? How will they make theym stronger, happier, or smarter? Do they confirm their world views? Do they solve a problem they have?



#### How do you ensure that your haters know that your projects are not for them at first glance?



#### Thinkg aboutlal the parts of your projkects that your fans will come in contact with (product design, customer service, marketing, tutorials, instructions, ect.) How can you make each as valuable and rpacticle as possible?



## One Thing At A Time

You should be feeling the dread of work creping in

Now thhat you're stressed: odn't be


When you step into action, it is absolutewly essential that you ocus on one thign at a time. Work on a project atleast for a couple of hours before you move onto something else.


Preppers can sometimes get stuck in analysis paralysis where they spend all day pondering their options isntead of actually doing anything. Runners tend to jumpfrom project to project, putting out fires without any focus, and spinners have no idea where to even start


## FETUS Index

7-70

The higher hte numbers, the more improtant the project


"I should abandon all my other projects until I'm done with this one. PPlease stop with the damn multitasking -it's a myth"


Get used to doing one thing at a time. Be Here. Be Present

Focus on where you are and what you're doing. Lernt o be patient and satisfied with you have.

Make a todo list
- music to help focus
- batch micro tasks

Put all of your focus and carte into one project ata a time. Make it as awesome as you possibly can, and work on it until it's done or until another project's FETUS index surpasses it

Procrastination si the name of the game we play when we're overwhelmed by our work.FETUS index tells you what to do next so can you focus on the work ,not the workload.

Fun, Effectiveness, Time, Urgency, Strategic Value
- 1-10
Lazy Number 7: I encourage you not to use avberage ratings (6/7)
- indifference typically means you should put down a lower number

## Fun
If you enjoy your work, you will do better at it. Write a 10 if you can't wait to work on your project and a 1 if you'd rather eat a bag of nails

## Effectiveness (x2)
How useful is this project to you in the short-term? A 10 is a life or death situation, and a 1 means that finishign this project as no direct  impact, double the value you come up with

## Time
Roughly how long will it take you to complete this project
- The bigger the more impactful probably
	- 1 = >10 minutes
	- 2 = > 30 minutes
	- 3 = > 1 hour
	- 4 = >3 hours
	- 5 = > 1 day
	- 6 = > 3 days
	- 7 = > 1 month
	- 8 = > 3 months
	- 9 = > 1 year
	- 10 = > 3 years

If yo estimate your project to run longer than three years, break ti into smaller chunks

## Urgency
When does yout owrk need to be done? Put a 10 if your project cannot wait, and a 1 if you have all the time in the world

## Strategic Value
Does this project move you clsoer to your dream (long term)? A 10 means this project is essential for your envisioned future, and a 1is for a side project that doesn't have any long-lasting impact on your life. Double teh value you come up with.


## Managing Projects
A value frmo 7 - 70 
	- consider dropping any projects below 35

### Rank your Projects

Once you'vbe figured out al;l fo your project scores, rank them highest to lowset. The higher a project ranks, the more important it is and hte mroe you should focus your efforts on it. You will styructure your weekly actions aroudn your highest ranking projects.


You also reassess your scores at the end of every week

### Determine Starting Actions
Which three actions will help yout he most in finishing your projects? Write them down on the morning page



# Chapter 4 - Habits




Our goal is to make you stronge,r happier, and smarter by doing a little bit of work every day. 

If you don't ahve thephysical, emotional, or intellectual energy, helpign others will eventually drain you


## Your Target You

Vividly picture yourself in 3 years: You've made it. You have the perfect life. Anyone who;d meet you for the first time would think you were a born RIder. You're cool, calm, collected, carry a warm smile on your face and wisdome in your words. Let's get strarted!


Here's How I act in my vision. Focus on your body language, teh way you speak, how you dflea with problems ,how slowly you do things:


Which of these could I be doing right now? Why am I not doing them yet?

How can I make it easier to do the things I'm not doing yet?

What do I already do every day that I do in my vision as well?
How can I increase their influence on my life? How can I  make them more fun, more relaxing, more rewarding?

Which fo my current habits pull me in a bad direction? How can I decrease their influence on my life? How can I make them less fun, less realaxing, less rewarding?


Based on all of this, here's  three habits that will get me closer to living my perfect life today:


Essential: Sports, meditaiton, reading

[[Triune Brain]]

Spprts = health habit
meditation = emotion habit
reading = intellect habit


People who meditate have more control over how they dealw ith pain and negative thoughts and consequently are less depressed. Meditation can reduce stress by as much as 40%

## Create something
It feels good to be able to look at/listen to/read/hold what you've been working on for the past few hiurs. dont miss out on thsi feeling

## Marketing
the best source to learn about marketing is digital-marketer.com
A subscription to their 'DM lab' is well worth the money and it's some fo t he best teaching i've ever seen

## Connect

Get out of your own ehad and be a part of the world


## Tidy up
Clean your room, minimize and remove clutter from your life.

## Experience 
If your life sems to follow the same formula everyday, make it a habit tisystematically break with this normalcy

## Cooking
Learnign how to cook isn't just fun, it's icnredibly useful

## Learn somethng
Follow hunches. If something seems fun, do it, asorb it and learnas mucha bout it as you can.


But as you delve into anything, if you have taken it seriously enough, you elarnthigns you never woul'dve learned otherwise. And this extra knowledge doesn't just make you smarter,  it makes you happier and wiser.



If you ta;l to yourself ina  destrcutive mannr, refrain frmo using negative statemtysnt aht only cost you willpower ("do not eat cake today"). Instead, formulare your habits positively ("when I go grocery shooping, I buy healthy food.")
- Proactive
- meta
- affirmitive
- empowering


For songwriters, I recommend aditional habits:
- Even if you don't ahve anyone to write for, write.
- Even if you odn't want to sing, it's kind of in the job description, so get some vocal lessons
- produce your own music
- practice piano
- practice guitar


## Forming Habits
You have to remember to start and then you ahve to do the work. It takes about 66 days for a habit tbecome second nature, but up until this point, when muscle memory takes over it will require attention and care.


### Reminders
Start by figuring out your triggers, moments n your day to day life that signal you to start your various habits. Instread of forcing yourself to remembr to do the dishes, conncect them to an activity you already do every day.
- dishes + watter refill

Pay special attention to your morning routine, as how you start your day has a profound efect on your overall consciousenstiousness.
If you want to cultivate a ahbit th at is difficult to connect o an existing routine, downlaod browser extension Blip Blip to use as a trigger

## Follow Through
Perform the dseried action right after the trigger. THe more reliably you do this and the more often per day, te qyuicker your brain datps. Consistency is more important tan quality! even if you just od the baremiinimum, your rbain memembers. This s why it's totally fine to start out small. Focus on the habituation, the routine, the quality comes later.


Missing once is ok, just don't let it happen twice in a row.

The hardest part of adopting a new habuit is when yout ake a day off. Your trigger no longer fires. Plan for these evntualities! be smart about this or hyour habit will b e over before it's even begun

## Planning Next Week

## Engine Building (1)

In the first column, write donw the habtis you wantr to add to your life, in the seconf olumn, how they ar etriggered. If you find a habit has become copletely second nature, you can stop tracking it and come up with a new one isntead. The mroe habits you have on auto-pilot, the easier habit forming itself and therefore your life will become.

## Diet Plan (2)

Plan what you will eat for lunch here.
- healthy eating beatrs diety every single time
	- No industry food, our bodies process real food thebest .Processed food is still a abrand new invention and our body simply can't deal with it.
	- No refined sugar, it f's up your body in the worst ways, leading to insulin resistance, inflammation, and ultimately diabetes and heart attacks. Fruit on the other hadn is ok, as it has enough other bits that make it healthy.
	- No soft drinks. Drink water only, add a slice of orange or lemon. Stay away from juices and smootheis sinc they either filter out all the healthy parts of the fruit or chang their texture so much that they lose all health benefits. One small glass of apple juice is 3-4 apples w/o the healthy bits. Apple juice and coca cola have the same amount of sugar in them.
	- No white flour, flour with all the nutrients filtered out
	- No empty calories, chips, toast, margarine, alcohol, candy don't satiate because they are missing protiens. You can eat a bnuch without feeling any less hungry.
	- No milk, milk shouln'dt me in a grown humans diet. Yogurt is very healthy though.
	- Eat enough protien. Unlike fat or carbs, your body can't actually survie without these. Protein is what makes you feel full after a meal, so increasing oyur protein intake will make you eat less in total. 
	- Don't snack, eat three times a day. If you are hungry, let yourslef be hungry. Learn to fight through that. give oyur ody the time betwen meals to digest. 
	- eat colorfully. Your body needs a lot of different nutriends and vitamins so don't eat anything dialy - mix thigns up. It can tell  the difference between supplements and real fool. Vegetarians houd take vitamin b12
	- Eat responsibly. Know where your food comes frmo and what kind of world tyour financing with your pruchases

Once youve figured out what youre going to eat, make a cgrocery list and buy everything you will need for the week all at once. This way, you dno't ahve to worry about grocery shopping for tghe rest of the week. It also reduces the risk of shopping when you;'re hungry, which can lead to bad decisions in teh snack aisle. Eating healthy is easier if you don't buy unhealthily.

its ok to eat junk food every once and a while if you eat healthy.
