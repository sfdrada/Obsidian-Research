# Unlimited Memory




# Chapter 1 - Introduction




```ad-quote
title: Brian Tracy
The great breakthrough in your life comes when you realize that you can learn anything you need to learn to accomplish any goal that you set for yourself. This means there are no limits on what you can be, have, or do!
```


## Only If You Can Remember Information Can You Live It

```ad-important
Understanding doesn't create use: only when you can instantly recall what you understand, and practice using your remembered understanding, do you achieve mastery. 
```

Learning -  Ability to acquire new information.
Memory - Ability to store & recall information overtime.

Knowledge always precedes skill


**It doesn't matter where you come from; all that matters is where you're going.**


```ad-quote
title: Jim Rohn
"The best advice I ever came across on the subject of concentration is: Wherever you are, be there."
```


# Chapter 2 - Excuse Me





```ad-quote
title: Zig Ziglar
"You cannot fly with the eagles if you continue to scratch with the turkeys."
```


```ad-Remember
Take the time to really think about your excuses and write them down, these are the same excuses every time. You can have success or excuses, but you can't have them both.

```

## I Am Helpless
Most Common Excuses:
- Not smart enough
- Not my nature
- I don't have time
- I don't have what it takes/not good genes
- I am too old/young

**Where your attention goes, your energy flows.**
- [[Sexual Kung Fu]]


## Someone Else Is To Blame

"I need support to develop these skills."

You always have two choices with your life and experience: you can either learn from it or you can place blame.


## Too Much Stress

We excuse ourselves into living mediocre lives. 
- Take responsibility for your situation & perspective
- Let go of disempowering beliefs


**If you believe your limits, your life will be very limited.** 



## TAKE ACTION NOW!

1. Who would you be if you keep holding onto your limitations?
2. Who would you be without your excuses?
	- Enter all learning with this mindset
3. Excuses are only negative beliefs you allow
4. Being the best version of yourself > excuses
5. Why are your goals important to you?

```ad-question

"We need more why-power not willpower"
```


# Chapter 3 - Never Believe A Lie





```ad-quote
title: Arnold Schwarzenegger
"The mind is the limit. As long as the mind can envision the fact that you can do something, you can do it - as long as you believe 100%."
```


```ad-quote
title: Richard Bandler
"Beliefs aren't about truth. Beliefs are about believing. They are guides for our behavior."
```



```ad-Remember
Create a belief system that supports your goals.
```




Your limiting beliefs will keep you trapped in a loop. 
- Self fulfilling prophecy
- Attack negative beliefs immediately & viciously
- 80% of changing anything is **why** you want to change & only 20% is about **how** you do it. 

1. Take responsibility
2. Question the belief
3. Create a new belief and reinforce it with memories, visualization, and real examples
4. Use the new belief often and make it a part of your identity.


**Your beliefs are only stories that you have accepted to be true about yourself... just decide to change the stories**

# Chapter 4 - Be Here Now

title: Alexander Graham Bell
"Concentrate all your thoughts on the task at hand. The sun's rays do not burn until brought to a focus."
```
