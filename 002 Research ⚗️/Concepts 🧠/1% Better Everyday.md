# 1% Better Everyday

## Theory


**Continuous Improvement** - Dedication to making small changes and improvements every day, with the expectation that those small improvements will add up to something significant.



The typical approach to self-improvement is to set a large goal, then try to take big leaps in order to accomplish the goal in as little time as possible. While this may sound good in theory, it often ends in burnout, frustration, and failure. 

Instead, we should focus on continuous improvement by slowly and slightly adjusting our normal everyday habits and behaviors.

But as time goes on, these small improvements or declines compound and you suddenly find a very big gap between people who make slightly better decisions on a daily basis and those who don't.

### Step 1: Do more of what already works

We often waste the resources and ideas at our fingertips because they don’t seem new and exciting.

Progress often hides behind boring solutions and underused insights. You don’t need more information. You don’t need a better strategy. You just need to do more of what already works.


### Step 2: Avoid tiny losses


In many cases, improvement is not about doing more things right, but about doing fewer things wrong.


This is a concept called improvement by subtraction,


### Step 3: Measure backward
Measuring backward means you make decisions based on what has already happened, not on what you want to happen.
