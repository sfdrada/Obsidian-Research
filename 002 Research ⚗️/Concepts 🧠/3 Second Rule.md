# 3 Second Rule

## Theory


Essentially, you had three seconds to go from seeing agirl you liked to chat her up. This was an effort to get guyspast the “stage fright” of cold approaching. The ThreeSecond Rule was an exercise to push past approach anxiety; it’s not an actual Game technique. 



The Three Second Rule exercise doesn’t count for much to guys who explain away their feigned disinterest. Thinking that you’re too cool for any girl who wouldn’t approach you first is coping.
