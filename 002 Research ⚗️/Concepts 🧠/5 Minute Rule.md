# 5 Minute Rule

## Theory


“When you start a new habit, it should take less than 5 minutes to do.”

nearly any habit can be scaled down
It’s not a strategy for starting, it’s the whole thing.
The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start.

once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it.



What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path.

You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your desired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy” to “very hard.”

master the habit of showing up


Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis.



reinforce the [identity](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits) you want to build.
