# Act

## Theory

Sometimes used to refer to individual [levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#level) or groups of levels that make up a larger [world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#world) or storyline. Rarely refers to a downloadable game intended to be part of a larger series which functions as a single game series and gameplay-wise. #Objective/R
