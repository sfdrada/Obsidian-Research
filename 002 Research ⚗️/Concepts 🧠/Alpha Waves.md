# Alpha Waves

## Theory
![[Alpha Wave.gif ]]

relaxed and receptive (alpha brainwaves),

relaxed state of awareness.

You may be daydreaming or carrying out a routine task that doesn’t demand too much thought such as taking a shower or light gardening.

Whilst in Alpha your stress is greatly reduced and you can experience greater imagination, creativity and flow.

You may be a little detached, enjoying relaxed absent-mindedness and you may be more receptive to hypnosis and auto-suggestion. The two halves of your brain naturally begin to synchronise and work together.


reduced stress and anxiety, reduced blood pressure and chronic pain. You may also experience feelings of euphoria and increased motivation and energy.


It may be tempting to think that you want to spend all of your time in Alpha but in reality you would probably be too relaxed to focus effectively on work and career and may daydream too much.

Alpha is ‘the power of now’, being here, in the present.
