# Anaerobic Exercise

## Theory

**Anaerobic Exercise:** Initially runs on aerobic until body can't keep up, then switches and burns fat & glycogen for energy.




## Sprinting
- High Intensity Interval Training
- Releases more [[Endorphins]] > Jogging
- More enjoyable > Jogging
- Burns more fat > jogging
	- Continues while resting
- **Increases Basal Metabolic Rate:** The amount of energy you need for your body to function well at rest
- Releases more Human Growth Hormone & [[Testosterone]]
	- Reduces [[Cortisol]]
		- Reduces more stress hormones
- Tears muscles more = More muscle building
	- Can increase injury %
- 


### High Intensity Repeat Training



[[Aerobic Exercise]] [[Cardio]]



### High Intensity Interval Training 
- Consistent optimal explosive performance after every rest interval
	- 1:6 work : rest ratio
- 10-20 seconds max effort
	- Cellular breakdown past this point
- Appropriate volume
	- Quality > Quantity
		- 4,6,8
early if detrimental returns
	- Finish with energy
#### Bad Habits
Leads to over-exhaustion & hunger cravings
- Done too frequently
- Duration too long
- Not enough recovery in between
