All things are created twice â€“ the first time it's created is in your mind and the second time is in the real world.

To get where you want to go in life, you need to have a map
- goals
- destination
- plan
- contingencies

	
personal mission statement. You need to make a conscious effort of where you want to end up or other people will control your life and where you end up going. This is why this habit is so important. You need to figure out your destination first and then work towards it.


If you're not really clear on what your purpose is, then think about the end of your life. How do you want to be remembered? Why do you want to be remembered for that? Find your purpose and make sure there is a strong why behind it.. Again, not something like having money, but something you have a real passion for.


nstead of asking what life has to offer, ask what you can offer life.


Create your ideal life and your legacy. It can be whatever you want. Dream big and don't hold yourself back. Most of the time, the thing that holds us back is ourselves. Don't let self doubt get in the way. Realize that anything is possible. Define how you want your life to be right now and don't let the past or anything else hold you back. You write the script to your life. No one else. You are the programmer.
