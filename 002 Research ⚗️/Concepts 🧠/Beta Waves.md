# Beta Waves

## Theory

![[Beta Wave.gif|#x-small]]
focused and ready for learning (beta brainwaves),

Beta brainwaves are produced when we are alert and engaged in mental activity, usually using the right side of our brain which is associated with logic, reasoning and spatial awareness.


When we are in an optimal Beta state we experience increased concentration, focus and alertness, improved logical thought and problem solving ability.


Taking stimulants such as coffee would cause an increase in Beta brainwaves and temporary improvements in these areas but spending too much time in a high Beta state is not good for us, leading to anxiety, unfocussed thoughts, an inability to relax or sleep properly and stress.  
Too little Beta, however, can lead to poor cognition, an inability to focus and perhaps depression and ADHD.


Beta brainwaves are further divided into three bands; Lo-Beta (Beta1, 12-15Hz) can be thought of as a 'fast idle', or musing. Beta (Beta2, 15-22Hz) is high engagement or actively figuring something out. Hi-Beta (Beta3, 22-38Hz) is highly complex thought, integrating new experiences, high anxiety, or excitement. Continual high frequency processing is not a very efficient way to run the brain, as it takes a tremendous amount of energy.
