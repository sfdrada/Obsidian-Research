# Biofeedback

## Theory


Biofeedback is a technique to help you learn to control internal functions normally outside of conscious control. You learn this by using sensitive instruments that measure and display physical or mental processes - making you aware of things that you can’t easily feel or detect on your own.




It’s very easy. With the help of instruments, you can see what you’re doing to improve your technique.



you can learn how to control muscle tension if you have a sensor showing you exactly how tense you are, when you are relaxing, and by how much (EMG biofeedback). Or, it’s simple to learn how to control your heart rhythm if you have a heart monitor giving you 'feedback' about what your heart rate is (HRV biofeedback).



Biofeedback is standard practice in sports performance. Its proven effectiveness has made it an accepted medical technique for decades; however few people or their doctors are aware of this logical, natural, self-regulatory alternative to medication.
