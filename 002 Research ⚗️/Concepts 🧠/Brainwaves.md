# Brainwaves

## Theory






The cyclical patterns of these electrical signals appear as a wave and have become known as brainwaves.  A brainwave frequency is measured in the number of times it cycles per second or hertz (Hz).

our state of mind depends on the state of our brainwave activity.  And our state of mind dictates how we perceive our world and make the most out of it.

when we are in a particular brain wave state, we can confidently predict our emotional state


 deliberately put ourselves into resourceful brain states as often as we can.  If we do this we can use our minds to improve our lives enormously.




The human brain is a complex organism made up of billions of brain cells called neurons.

These neurons are constantly at work, communicating with each other and building new connections within your brain.

The communication physically occurs by these cells emitting electrical signals which are received by other cells who, in turn are sending out their own communicating electrical signals.

When millions of these neurons are all communicating at once, it generates a significant amount of electrical activity which can be picked up by a sensitive recording device called an electroencephalograph machine, or EEG.

The combined electrical activity recorded is called a brainwave pattern – or just brainwave


	We can train our brains into different brainwaves through relation and meditation practices but these methods are sometimes difficult and take a long time to master if we try to master them without external stimuli.


But your brainwave frequency isn’t just the result of being in a particular state. It can work both ways – deliberately adjusting your brainwave frequencies can actually put you in a particular state.

## Application

### Binaural Beats

binaural beat are a way to get our brain into a particular state by listening to an audio file.



If you strike a tuning fork and then hold another one close to it, the second will start to vibrate at exactly the same frequency.  It is known as Frequency Following Response and is also known as entrainment.Your brain does the same thing and if you expose it to a frequency, it will follow that frequency.

But the human ear generally can’t hear below 20Hz so how can we listen to frequencies that will benefit us?  By using binaural beats.

That file plays a tone in one ear of, say 200Hz, and a different tone in the other ear of 210Hz.  The brain then ‘hears’ a third tone of the difference between the two ie 10Hz which leads the brain to a frequency that will result in a feeling of relaxation.

 for the technique to work you must listen with [headphones suitable for binaural beats](https://binauralbeatsguru.com/best-headphones-for-binaural-beats/) which must not add bass or other effects to the basic audio file.


### Isochronic Tones


They are computer generated fast pulses that gently entrain the brain and are the most potent entrainment method.  The tones are precise and allow a specific Hz to be heard.

The same tone goes into each ear so headphones are not mandatory but your experience will be greater if you still use them with isochronic tones as you will hear the tones better and background distractions are minimised.
