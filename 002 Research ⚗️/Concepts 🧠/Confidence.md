# Confidence

## Theory

“Hi. Are you the sort of person I should get to know better?” If she says “Yes”, then ask “Why?”
- Frame of the conversation = what she can offer you

being confident is something you think about and which ultimately reveals that you must be nervous in one way or another after all. 
- Ideally you feel so good and natural about it that the word “confidence” never pops up in your mind
	- Feeling so good and natural that you have no need to think about being confident is actually the ultimate confidence


Forget the term “confidence” altogether, just concentrate on feeling good and natural
- Confident is how you'll be percieved



When seeing a girl you’d like to approach, don’t even try to “feel confident”. Instead, think: “See that girl? I am the perfect experience for her!”. Think of the way she will have goosbumps from the way you’ll make her feel good, and if you want to, then for just a split-second you can remind yourself of all the ways you could make her cum
