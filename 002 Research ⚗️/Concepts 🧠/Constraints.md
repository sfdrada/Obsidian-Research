# Constraints

Certainly, some of these constraints do hold us back. However, there is also a positive side. The constraints in our lives often force us to make choices and cultivate talents that would otherwise go undeveloped.


drive creativity and foster skill development.









## How To Choose The Right Constraints


**1. Decide what specific skill you want to develop.**

The more specific the skill, the easier it will be to design a good constraint.

[[S.M.A.R.T. Goals]]



**2. Design a constraint that requires this specific skill to be used.**

There are three main options for designing a constraint: time, resources, and environment.


1.  **Time:** Give yourself less time to accomplish a task or set a schedule that forces you to work on a skill more consistently.
2.  **Resources:** Give yourself fewer resources (or different resources) to do a task. (More on this idea [here](https://jamesclear.com/vexillology).)
3.  **Environment:** Environmental constraints are best because they impact your behavior without you realizing it.
- External
- Game Related
- Internal


**1. Constraints inspire your creativity.**
**2. Constraints force you to get something done.**

But constraints are not the enemy. Every artist has a limited set of tools to work with. Every athlete has a limited set of skills to train with. Every entrepreneur has a limited amount of resources to build with. Once you know your constraints, you can start figuring out how to work with them.


## The Size of Your Canvas

if we want to find happiness and meaning in our lives, then we need more: more opportunity, more wealth, and more _things_.

We start to believe that moving somewhere new will remove the messiness of life.



*“The more a person limits himself, the more resourceful he becomes.”  
—Soren Kierkegaard




It can be easy to spend your life complaining about the opportunities that are withheld from us and the resources that we need to make our goals a reality.

But there is an alternative. You can [use your constraints to drive creativity](https://jamesclear.com/dr-seuss "How to use constraints to drive creativity."). You can [embrace your limitations to foster skill development](https://jamesclear.com/futsal "How to use limitations to build new skills."). The problem is rarely the opportunities we have, but how we use them.
