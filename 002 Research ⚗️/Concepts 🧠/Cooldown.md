# Cooldown

The minimum length of time that the player needs to wait after using an [ability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill_(role-playing_games) "Skill (role-playing games)") before they can use it again.


 cooldown can be thought of as an inverted "casting time" where instead of requiring a wait time before using an ability, cooldown may replace casting time and put the wait after the ability is activated. This creates a new dimension to the balancing act of casting speed versus power: "lower cooldown, faster cast, but weaker strength" versus "higher cooldown, slower cast, but greater strength".
 
Each move has a certain number of frames in which it is considered to be "recovering" before another move can be executed, which is similar to cooldown in concept. However, there is no player control over the character during recovery frames, and the character can not perform any movement or attacks until fully recovered. Because the character is vulnerable during recovery, strategic use of skills is necessary to make sure the opponent cannot immediately counter the player-character.
