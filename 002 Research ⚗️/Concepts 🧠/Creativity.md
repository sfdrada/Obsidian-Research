# Creativity



## The 5 Stages Of The Creative Process

creative thinking is not about generating something new from a blank slate, but rather about [taking what is already present and combining those bits and pieces in a way that has not been done previously](https://jamesclear.com/dont-start-from-scratch).




the ability to generate new combinations hinges upon your ability to see the [relationships between concepts](https://jamesclear.com/feynman-mental-models). If you can form a new link between two old ideas, you have done something creative



1.  **Gather new material.** At first, you learn. During this stage you focus on 1) learning specific material directly related to your task and 2) learning general material by becoming fascinated with a wide range of concepts.
2.  **Thoroughly work over the materials in your mind.** During this stage, you examine what you have learned by looking at the facts from different angles and experimenting with fitting various ideas together.
3.  **Step away from the problem.** Next, you put the problem completely out of your mind and go do something else that excites you and energizes you.
4.  **Let your idea return to you.** At some point, but only after you have stopped thinking about it, your idea will come back to you with a flash of insight and renewed energy.
5.  **Shape and develop your idea based on feedback.** For any idea to succeed, you must release it out into the world, submit it to criticism, and adapt it as needed.



## Don't Start From Scratch

Starting from scratch is usually a bad idea.

 we assume innovative ideas and meaningful changes require a blank slate.

However, [creative progress](https://jamesclear.com/creativity) is rarely the result of throwing out all previous ideas and innovations and completely re-imagining of the world.

 Innovative thinkers don't create, they connect. Furthermore, the most effective way to make progress is usually by [making 1 percent improvements to what already works](https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains) rather than breaking down the whole system and starting over.

## Iterate, Don't Originate

We are mostly blind to the remarkable interconnectedness of things. This is important to understand because in a complex world it is hard to see which forces are working for you as well as which forces are working against you


When you are dealing with a complex problem, it is usually better to build upon what already works. Any idea that is currently working has passed a lot of tests. [Old ideas are a secret weapon](https://jamesclear.com/old-ideas) because they have already managed to survive in a complex world.



## Value Old Ideas
What we fail to understand is that the fundamentals are not merely a collection of good ideas. The fundamentals are a collection of good ideas that outlasted thousands of bad ideas.


I'd like to propose that sometimes the creative thing to do is to actually practice the fundamentals more consistently than everyone else. Most people don’t fully use the knowledge they already have.
