# Delta Waves

## Theory

![[Delta Wave.gif|#x-small]]
deep relaxation and sleep (delta brainwaves) .


 occur naturally during deep dreamless sleep when the body heals and releases several hormones to promote anti-aging and maintenance of skin, bone and joints.
 as we age we tend to produce less Delta waves, even when asleep.


the state of deepest relaxation and Delta waves have been found to be involved in unconscious body functions such as digestion and maintenance of the immune system.

If we receive enough Delta waves during the night we would wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Reasonable amounts of Delta brainwaves can help you be more understanding and compassionate towards others.

Too much Delta can cause some learning problems and an inability to think and focus and too little Delta may result in poor sleep and and an inability ro revitalise the body and/or brain.

Some people believe that whilst in a Delta state we have access to the unconscious mind and a collective or universal unconscious, making available to us information unavailable at a conscious level.

Healing and regeneration are stimulated in this state, and that is why deep restorative sleep is so essential to the healing process.
