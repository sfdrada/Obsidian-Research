# Endowment Effect

The endowment effect is a physiological behaviour based on the concepts of loss aversion and ownership bias. It’s what causes you to think that the item you own should cost more than what people are 
normally
 willing to pay for it. 



The endowment effect is a psychological behaviour that makes us believe something has more value than it actually does just because it belongs to us. 

As a seller, the endowment 
effects
 tends to mean you have to work twice as hard to sell something to your customer. Buyers start out already thinking your product isn’t worth what you’re asking for it.


, if you can figure out a way to make your prospect or clients feel like they’re 
already
 “owners” of your product or brand then it’s possible to increase conversions. 

 requires strategic marketing and psychology 
knowledge
 to do it right


If ownership will make prospects more likely to see the product price as acceptable, then actually giving them the product for free is genius. Because a giveaway gives them instant ownership but forces them to convert in order to make use of it you’re getting double the benefit. For example, if you’re offering one free accessory when they spend a certain dollar amount, they do get the free item but they actually have to buy to reach it.  


. The free trial technique is a perfect example of that. While they don’t actually “have” the product just yet, getting to use it unrestricted for a while will make them feel like they do. By the time the trial runs out that ownership feeling will have set in. 


f accessing the premium features for free. The secret to this technique is to offer the right premium features – not all of them. If you’re strategic about it and choose them based on your target consumer then you’ll be making a good case in convincing them to upgrade their account.


. Have prospects (and existing clients) help choose a new limited edition shoe color, or decide what the subject of your next TV show will be. You can even have them vote for what new software feature you should design next. Non-tangible 
assets
 are a perfect way to make the endowment effect work for you.  

 Our human brain loves gaining new things, but it hates even more losing something it 
already
 has. This means that when a choice is presented to us we’re likely to focus more on what we would potentially be losing than what we would be gaining.  

ownership bias. When something is officially ours we tend to attach emotional value to it which prevents us from being objective. While the true, market value of the thing never changes the second it belongs to us we feel like it’s worth more just because it’s ours.

The easiest way to prevent yourself from falling for the endowment effect is to be aware of the opposite thing it’s trying to accomplish.
