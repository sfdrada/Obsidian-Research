# First Principles

 reasoning from first principles, is one of the most effective strategies you can employ for breaking down complicated problems and generating original solutions.
 
  
  It also might be the single best approach to learn how to think for yourself.


 reason from first principles rather than by analogy.


First principles thinking is the act of boiling a process down to the fundamental parts that you know are true and building up from there.

A first principle is a basic assumption that cannot be deduced any further.

 _What are we absolutely sure is true? What has been proven?_


requires you to dig deeper and deeper until you are left with only the foundational truths of a situation.





d Cartesian Doubt in which he would “systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt until he was left with what he saw as purely indubitable truths.”


Deconstruct then reconstruct.


One of the primary obstacles to first principles thinking is our tendency to optimize _form_ rather than _function_.

What looks like innovation is often an iteration of previous forms rather than an improvement of the core function.

The human tendency for imitation is a common roadblock to first principles thinking. When most people envision the future, they project the current _form_ forward rather than projecting the _function_ forward and abandoning the form.


Old conventions and previous forms are often accepted without question and, once accepted, they set a boundary around creativity.


Continuous improvement tends to occur within the boundary set by the original vision. By comparison, first principles thinking requires you to abandon your allegiance to previous forms and put the function front and center.



Every innovation, including the most groundbreaking ones, requires a long period of iteration and improvement.
