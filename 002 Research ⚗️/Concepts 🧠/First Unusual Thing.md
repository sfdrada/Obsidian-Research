# First Unusual Thing


Pick up on the **First Unusual Thing** you notice and call it out in some way -> Justify it -> If this is true, what else is true?
- the crazier justifications the better in game/comedy
- Exaggerating assumptions = more fun
- just has to be interesting and the humor will come
- everything interaction is different = blank slate
- Risky but way more fun & interesting
	- can create a sexual assumption


## How To Practice
1. Together: Practice w/ a friend
2. Solo: Practice on any visual scenario


**The more ridiculous, the more you are able to get away with it
