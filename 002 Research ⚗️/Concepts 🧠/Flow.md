# Flow
With the right conditions you completely immersed in work you lose track of time with effortless progress.  


This wonderful blend of happiness and peak performance is sometimes referred to as flow


Flow is the mental state you experience when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away.


s your state of peak motivation.



One factor that researchers have found is linked to flow states is whether or not you are following The Goldilocks Rule we mentioned earlier.

f you are working on challenges of optimal difficulty, then you will not only be motivated but also experience a boost in happiness.


In order to reach this state of peak performance, however, you not only need to work on challenges at the right degree of difficulty, but also measure your immediate progress


 “you get immediate feedback about how you are doing at each step.”


 facing an optimal challenge and receiving immediate feedback about the progress you are making toward that challenge are two of the most critical components of peak motivation.
