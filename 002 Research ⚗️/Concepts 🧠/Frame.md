# Frame



[[Sterling Cooper Dirty Talk 101 ðŸ““]] Frame = The perspective you choose to view an event or situation from.

- 'A beautiful woman rejects you'
	- I am unnatractive and not good enough for her
	- **Every rejection is a brick in my palace, the more immune to rejection I become, the more confident I will be and thus the more attractive I will be. I just got one step closer to becoming more attractive to women and getting the women I want in my life.
- Your small business fails
	- I am terrible at business and will never make money
	- **I just learned what not to do and I am going to take those lessons and apply them to my next adventure**
