# Gamma Waves

## Theory

![[Gamma Wave.gif|#x-small]]
 super intuitive and empathetic (gamma brainwaves)


Gamma brain waves are brain activity of a frequency between 25Hz to 100Hz with an average of 40hz being considered the norm.



 gamma state is able to link information from all parts of the brain and that the whole brain experiences and is influenced by the gamma wave.




n improve our feelings of satisfaction, happiness and empathy and compassion with others.


  
greater cognitive functioning, along with memory retention, data processing and ability to focus clearly.   Being in gamma gives us the ability to process large amounts of information quickly and often gives us flashes of insight and intuition.


 can make us use our IQ and feel in the zone.   Experiencing more gamma brainwaves can upgrade the capability of your brain!

, low amounts of gamma production can point to possible poor mental health, learning difficulties, low memory capacity and reduced mental processing.


A list of some of the benefits of gamma brainwaves are really impressive!

-   Improve your powers of memory, with vivid recall capacity.
-   Become better able to recall past experiences including names of people you met, music you heard and conversations you had.
-   Access all parts of your brain for higher levels of intelligence.
-   Increases feelings of happiness, empathy and self-control
-   Heighten levels of mental alertness, brain functioning and mental processing.
-   Increase your perception of all five senses -sight, sound, smell, taste, touch.
-   Greater ability to focus on both individual tasks and all sensory information as a whole.
-   Process large amounts of information at once and make sense of it all.
-   Can result in bursts of gamma leading to moments of insight and inspiration  – Eureka moments!

People who naturally have high levels of gamma activity have been to found to be very intelligent, compassionate and happy.  They have great memories and exercise strong self control.  High brain activity in gamma puts us in a state of peak performance.



High achievers in most fields but such as top athletes and musicians will usually generate far more gamma waves than average.


 people who suffer from depression often display low gamma activity.


But specifically you should try to increase your gamma waves if:
-    You feel you are not functioning at your best
-    You are starting to feel overwhelmed processing everything going on in life
-    You are experiencing difficulty remembering things such as dates, names or events from the past.
-    You need to focus on the big picture, such as studying for exams
-    You suffer from depression, sadness or loneliness (not an alternative to seeking medical help for depression)


-    Intense focus
-   Increased energy
-   Increased empathy and social engagement
-   Better information processing
-   Intuitive moments and Aha! experiences
-   Boosted Creativity
-   Improved moods and a happier outlook

The most subtle of the brainwave frequencies, the mind has to be quiet to access gamma.

highly active when in states of universal love, altruism, and the ‘higher virtues’. Gamma is also above the frequency of neuronal firing, so how it is generated remains a mystery. It is speculated that gamma rhythms modulate perception and consciousness, and that a greater presence of gamma relates to expanded consciousness and [spiritual emergence](https://brainworksneurotherapy.com/neurofeedback-spiritual-development).
