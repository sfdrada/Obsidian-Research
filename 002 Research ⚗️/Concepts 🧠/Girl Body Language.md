# Girl Body Language

Doesn’t matter whether she is interested in you, you’ll make her interested eventually anyway



# **When talking to a girl, these are some of the more important signs to watch for:**

-   Can you keep conversation going with her?
-   Does she react well to kino?
-   Does she touch you?
-   Does she laugh?


Make sure that you watch her closely and as soon as you get a sign that should be an indication that you are on the right track, keep going in that direction. If the opposite happens, just change the subject and see what happens.

An average girl first just looks at your face and then progresses into the more overt signs of interest described above, looking at your face from time to time might be the only sign of interest you’ll ever get from the most beautiful of girls.





**Her lips:**
-   Big smiles with upper and lower teeth showing with a relaxed face. Biting of the lips or showing of the tongue, licking her lips or touching of her front teeth.
-  She wets her lips, some women use only a single-lip lick, wetting the upper or lower lip, while others run the tongue around the entire lip area.
-   She puts her fingernail between her teeth.
-   She protrudes her lips and thrust her breasts forward.


**Her eyes:**

-   She gazes in your eyes with deep interest and her pupils are dilated.
-   She raises both eyebrows exaggeratedly for a couple of seconds, this is often combined with a smile and some eye contact.
-   She winks at you while talking to you or winks at you from a distance.
-   While talking to you, she blinks more than usual, fluttering her eyelashes.
-   Eyebrows raised and then lowered, then a smile indicates interest in you.

**Her hair:**

-   She pushes her fingers through her hair. This can be one hand movement or more of a stroking motion.
-   She twirls her hair around her fingers while she is looking at you.
-   She is throwing her hair back off her shoulders.


**Her clothing:**

-   If she is wearing clothes that show her nipples underneath and you notice they are getting perky and erect.
-   The hem goes up to expose a little more leg.
-   She is fixing, patting or smoothing her outfit to make herself look better.



**While she is seated:**

-   She moves in time to the music, with her eyes on you.
-   She starts sitting straight up and her muscles appear to be firm.
-   She is sitting with her legs open.
-   She sits with her legs crossed in a manner to reveal her thigh.
-   Her legs are rubbing against each other.
-   Her legs are rubbing against the leg of the table.
-   Her crossed leg is pointed towards you or if that same leg is rocking back and forth towards you.



**Miscellaneous:**

-   She mirrors your body language and body positions.
-   Her skin tone becomes red while being around you.
-   She blows smoke straight out from between her lips and toward you.
-   She leans over and speaks into her friend’s ear, just like in junior high school.
-   She is standing with her head cocked slightly at an angle, one foot behind the other, hips slightly thrust forward.
-   At a party – every once in a while she seems to appear out of nowhere in your vicinity and if you move to another spot, soon she appears out of nowhere again, you catch her glancing in your general direction (YOU), she bumps into you... accidentally, touches you...

In social settings, most of us start out in a closed, defensive posture because we’re a bit apprehensive. A closed posture feels safe. When the person you are talking with shifts to a more open posture, it signifies trust and comfort.
-  If you go first, she, or he, will usually follow your move from closed to slightly more open. 
	- Slow, gradual shifts of posture.
