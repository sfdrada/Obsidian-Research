# Habits 

**Habits** The small decisions you make and actions you perform every day.


account for about 40 percent of our behaviors on any given day.

Your life today is essentially the sum of your habits


What you repeatedly do (i.e. what you spend time thinking about and doing each day) ultimately forms the person you are, the things you believe, and the personality that you portray.


what we measure, we improve
The trick is to realize that counting, measuring, and tracking is not about the result. It's about [the system, not the goal](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems "systems vs. goals").

Measure from a place of curiosity. Measure to discover, to find out, to understand.


take the main idea and use it in a way that is best for you

If you want to summarize the habits of successful people into one phrase, it's this: successful people start before they feel ready.

If you’re working on something important, then you’ll never feel ready. A side effect of doing challenging work is that you’re pulled by excitement and pushed by confusion at the same time.

You’re bound to feel uncertain, unprepared, and unqualified. But let me assure you of this: what you have right now is enough. You can plan, delay, and revise all you want, but trust me, what you have now is enough to start.


We all start in the same place: no money, no resources, no contacts, no experience. The difference is that some people — the winners — choose to start anyway.




*“Failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy to finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one area where I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter, and a big idea. And so rock bottom became a solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.”

_—_ J.K. Rowling*

luck does play a role in life. But luck is just an opportunity. It's just an open door. You have to decide to walk through it and to make something of it.



The people who end up looking like the “chosen ones” — the best-selling authors, the successful business owners, the elite athletes, the talented artists — are successful first and foremost because they chose themselves before they had any measure of success.
And that's the piece of success that isn't as easy to accept because it often means betting on yourself when you feel like a failure.

But there's nothing glamourous about battling through failure and uncertainty. There's nothing easy about choosing yourself when each day feels like a struggle to keep your head above water.

_“It doesn't matter whether or not it's my fault that I'm here. This is who I am and it's my responsibility to do something about it.”_



## The Habit Loop
![[Habit Loop.png]]
 an endless feedback loop that is running and active during every moment you are alive


The brain is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results. The entire process is completed in a split second, and we use it again and again without realizing everything that has been packed into the previous moment.
By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are running our lives.


 After decades of mental programming, we automatically slip into these patterns of thinking and acting.


### Cue

The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.

Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction.

indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction, which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)

Because the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.

#### Cue 1: Time


Time is perhaps the most common way to trigger a new habit

triggers a cascade of habits

If these patterns are bad habits, then you may want to take stock of how you feel at this time of day.

In many cases, your habits are a signal of how you feel.

if you understand the reason why these habits pop up at the same time each day, then it can become easier to find a new habit to fill the void

 It doesn’t matter how long or how short the article is. All that matters is that I [stick to the schedule](https://jamesclear.com/schedule-goals "Schedule your goals.").

#### Cue 2: Location

 In many cases, our habits and behaviors are simply a response to the environment that surrounds us.


 location-based cues are not simply things we respond to, they can also be things we create.


One theory is that we mentally assign habits to a particular location. This means that all of the current places that you’re familiar with (your home, your office, etc.) already have behaviors, habits, and routines assigned to them.

If you want to build new habits in these familiar locations, then you need to overcome the cues that your brain has already assigned to that area.

 building a new habit in a new location is like having a blank slate. You don’t have to overcome any pre-existing triggers.

Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start.

#### Cue 3: Preceding Event

Many habits are a response to something else that happens in your life.

When it comes to cues that are useful for building new habits, I find preceding events to be one of the most useful. Once you understand [habit stacking](https://jamesclear.com/habit-stacking "habit stacking") you can develop all sorts of ways to tie new habits into preceding events.




#### Cue 4: Emotional State

emotional state is a common cue for bad habits

although emotions are very common cues for our behavior, I find that they are harder to control and utilize for building good habits.

if you want an emotion to trigger a positive habit, then you often need to be consciously aware of the emotion as you are experiencing it. In other words, you have to be emotional and aware at the same time … and that can be hard to do.


[Paying attention](https://jamesclear.com/awareness-start-better-habits "New habits and awareness") is a powerful, but difficult, way to build better habits.

#### Cue 5: Other People


the people you surround yourself with can play a role in your habits and behaviors.


if your friend becomes obese, then your risk of obesity increases by 57 percent — even if your friend lives hundreds of miles away.


*“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.”
-Jim Rohn*

**The key to choosing a successful cue is to pick a trigger that is very specific and immediately actionable.**

self-experimentation is the only real answer. Play around with these five habit cues and see what works for you.







### Craving
Cravings are the second step of the habit loop, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act

What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers.

 any piece of information could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not motivated by the same cues.
 
 Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving


 Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act.
### Response
 The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action.

 Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior.
f a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it

 but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it.

Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it.
### Reward
 Rewards are the end goal of every habit

The cue is about noticing the reward
. The craving is about wanting the reward. 
The response is about obtaining the reward

We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards provide benefits on their own.

rewards deliver contentment and relief from craving.


Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector.


Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones.[](https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change#) Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.


And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future.

Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.


### The Problem Phase
The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change.
### The Solution Phase
The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire.


All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem





## How To Build New Habits

**Synaptic Prunin** - Your brain prunes away connections between neurons that don't get used and builds up connections that get used more frequently.

he connections become faster and more efficient each time you practice. As your brain builds stronger and faster connections between neurons, you can express your skills with more ease and expertise. It is a biological change that leads to skill development.


### Habit Stacking

The more you do something, the stronger and more efficient the connection becomes.


**Habit Stacking** - One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top.

Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit.

The habit stacking formula is:

> After/Before [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].



the reason habit stacking works so well is that your current habits are already built into your brain. You have patterns and behaviors that have been strengthened over years. By linking your new habits to a cycle that is already built into your brain, you make it more likely that you'll stick to the new behavior.

allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading into the next.

 increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one.


Create a habit stacking list


you always have a game plan for which action should come next.

No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.

Consider when you are most likely to be successful.

Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit.

 you can create a list with two columns. In the first column, write down the habits you do each day without fail. In the second column, write down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail.

Armed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.

works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable.

 The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.



### Habit Scorecard

Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent.  Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.



Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.
 eyes, hands, mouth, and ears


The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will be just like the last. We’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that we don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness.


One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing.

To create your own Habits Scorecard, start by making a list of your daily habits.

Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.


The labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate. There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them.

You can categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run. Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative outcomes.

Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are typically bad.


As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on. Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal criticism. Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for your successes.

The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. Strategies like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are focused on getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them, which makes it easier to discover which habits you should change and respond in a way that benefits you.



## How To Form Better Habits


Every habit you have — good or bad — follows the same 3–step pattern: Reminder (the trigger that initiates the behavior), routine (the behavior itself; the action you take), and reward (the benefit you gain from doing the behavior).

**The Four Laws Of Behavior Change** -  When the conditions are in the right positions, creating good habits is effortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly impossible.
![[Routine Structure.png]]

The key to creating good habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental laws and how to alter them to your specifications. Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature.








## How To Break Bad Habits

 removing yourself from an environment that triggers all of your old habits, you can make it easier to break bad habits and build new ones.

 A bright-line rule refers to a clearly defined rule or standard. It is a rule with clear interpretation and very little wiggle room.
- what the rule is saying and what it is not saying

Most of the time, bad habits are simply a way of dealing with stress and boredom



You can teach yourself new and healthy ways to deal with stress and boredom, which you can then substitute in place of your bad habits.

 sometimes the stress or boredom that is on the surface is actually caused by deeper issues.



if you're serious about making changes then you have to be honest with yourself.

Are there certain beliefs or reasons that are behind the bad habits?
Recognizing the causes of your bad habits is crucial to overcoming them.

Because bad habits provide some type of benefit in your life, it's very difficult to simply eliminate them.
 you need to replace a bad habit with a new habit that provides a similar benefit.

If you expect yourself to simply cut out bad habits without replacing them, then you'll have certain needs that will be unmet and it's going to be hard to stick to a routine of “just don't do it” for very long.


**Choose a substitute for your bad habit.**

You need to have a plan ahead of time for how you will respond when you face the stress or boredom that prompts your bad habit.

**Cut out as many triggers as possible.**
Make it easier on yourself to break bad habits by avoiding the things that cause them.

**Join forces with somebody.**

Instead, pair up with someone and quit together. The two of you can hold each other accountable and celebrate your victories together.
- [ ] Make a Habit Pair App?
      
**Surround yourself with people who live the way you want to live.**

**Visualize yourself succeeding.**


**You don't need to be someone else, you just need to return to the old you.**
So often we think that to break bad habits, we need to become an entirely new person. The truth is that you already have it in you to be someone without your bad habits.
You don't need to transform into a healthy person, you just need to return to being healthy.
Every time you slip up or make a mistake, it's easy to tell yourself how much you suck.[](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-break-a-bad-habit#)

Whenever that happens, finish the sentence with “but”…

**Use the word “but” to overcome negative self–talk.**

[[Plan For Failure]]

*“When you screw up, skip a workout, eat bad foods, or sleep in, it doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you human. Welcome to the club.”
-Steve Kamb*


It's easy to get caught up in how you _feel_ about your bad habits. You can make yourself feel guilty or spend your time dreaming about how you wish things were … but these thoughts take you away from what's actually happening.

Instead, it's awareness that will show you how to actually make change.

-   When does your bad habit actually happen?
-   How many times do you do it each day?
-   Where are you?
-   Who are you with?
-   What triggers the behavior and causes it to start?

Each time your bad habit happens, mark it down on your paper. At the end of the day, count up all of the tally marks and see what your total is.

The only goal is to be aware of when it happens and how often it happens. Wrap your head around the problem by being aware of it

Breaking bad habits takes time and effort, but mostly it takes perseverance.

## How To Make Habits Stick


### Identity Strategy
 In order to believe in a new identity, we have to prove it to ourselves.


focusing on creating a new identity first. Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity.


What you do now is a mirror image of the type of person you believe that you are (either consciously or subconsciously).



![[Behavior Change Layers.png]]





**The first layer is changing your outcomes.** This level is concerned with changing your results
Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.

**The second layer is changing your process.** This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems
Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.

**The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.** This level is concerned with changing your beliefs
Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.


Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe


When it comes to building habits that last—when it comes to building a system of 1 percent improvements—the problem is not that one level is “better” or “worse” than another. All levels of change are useful in their own way. The problem is the _direction_ of change.


Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on _what_ they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on _who_ we wish to become.



### Paper Clip Strategy
Success is often a result of committing to the fundamentals over and over again.

 a [visual trigger](https://jamesclear.com/habit-triggers "The 5 Triggers That Make New Habits Stick") that can help motivate you to perform a habit with more consistency.
I’ve heard from readers who have employed it in a variety of ways. One woman shifted a hairpin from one container to another whenever she wrote a page of her book. Another man moved a marble from one bin to the next after each set of push-ups.

hey reinforce your behavior and add little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity.

**Visual cues remind you to start a behavior.**
This is why a visual stimulus, like a bin full of paper clips, can be so useful. It is much easier to stick with good habits [when your environment nudges you in the right direction](https://jamesclear.com/choice-architecture "Habits, choice architecture, and environment design.").


**Visual cues display your progress on a behavior.**

ew people [actually measure how consistent they are](https://jamesclear.com/measuring "What are you measuring in your life?") in real life. The Paper Clip Strategy avoids that pitfall because it is a built-in measuring system. One look at your paper clips and you immediately have a measure of your progress.



**Visual cues can have an additive effect on motivation.**

[[Endowment Effect]]

**Visual cues can be used to drive short-term and long-term motivation.**

The Paper Clip Strategy can provide daily motivation, but you start from scratch each day. However, another type of visual cue, like the “Don’t Break the Chain” Calendar that I described in [my article on the Seinfeld Strategy](https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy "How to stop procrastinating by using the Seinfeld Strategy") can be used to showcase your consistency over longer periods of time.

By stacking these two methods together, you can create a set of visual cues that motivate and measure your habits over the short-run and the long-run.



## Self Beliefs

### Identity-Based Habits
1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

work backward from the results you want to the type of person who could get those results.



, when you want to become better at something, proving your identity to yourself is far more important than getting amazing results


You can't rely on being [motivated](https://jamesclear.com/motivation). You have to become the type of person you want to be, and that starts with proving your new identity to yourself



___
Habit graduation is about considering your goals and your current average speed, and thinking about how you can increase your output by just a little bit on a consistent basis.

The important thing isn’t to judge yourself or feel guilty about having a lower average speed than you would like. The important thing is to be aware of what’s actually going on, realize that it’s within your control, and then embrace the fact that a small, but consistent change in your daily habits can lead to a remarkable increase in your average speed.




### Identity-Votes

Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.


your habits are how you _embody_ your identity.


The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word _identity_ was originally derived from the Latin words _essentitas_, which means being, and, _identidem_, which means _repeatedly_. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”

 your habits are not the only actions that influence your identity, but by virtue of their frequency they are usually the most important ones.
Each experience in life modifies your self-image

 As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.

 We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit.[](https://jamesclear.com/identity-votes#) We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.


 This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.


The most practical way to change _who_ you are is to change _what_ you do.


Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.

o. Every time you choose to perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is that you don’t need to be perfect.

Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.

New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.





## Amateurs VS. Professionals

The ability to show up everyday, stick to the schedule, and do the work — especially when you don't feel like it — is so valuable that it is literally all you need to become better 99% of the time.


Approaching your goals — whatever they are — with the attitude of a professional isn't easy. In fact, being a pro is painful.

The simple fact of the matter is that most of the time we are inconsistent.


Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work towards it with purpose, amateurs get pulled off course by the [urgencies of life](https://jamesclear.com/are-you-living-an-urgent-life-or-an-important-one).


“Professionals work harder than everyone else and that's why they're great.” Actually, that's not it at all.

Being a pro is about having the discipline to commit to what is important to you instead of merely saying something is important to you. It's about starting when you feel like stopping, not because you want to work more, but because your goal is important enough to you that you don't simply work on it when it's convenient. Becoming a pro is about making your priorities a reality.

, but I’ve never regretted showing up and working on something that is important to me.


Becoming a pro doesn't mean you're a workaholic. It means that you’re good at making time for what matters to you — especially when you don't feel like it — instead of playing the role of the victim and letting life happen to you.





### How To Be A Pro

**1. Decide what you want to be good at.**
**2. Set a schedule for your actions.**
**3. Stick to your schedule for one week.**
