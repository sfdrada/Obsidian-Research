# 40 Hz
Sound frequencies at 40 hertz have been linked to the effective stimulation of memory and increased neural response efficiency. This specific frequency has been shown to activate gamma brainwaves, which are shown to be involved with higher brain functions like memory and cognition.


# 147 Hz

The 147-hertz frequency has been said to be effective in promoting clarity and intellectual organization, as it resonates with the cerebral cortex, which is largely responsible for conscious thought processes and creativity.

It has also been linked to decreasing inflammation from injury or infection and reducing the amount of scar tissue that forms internally on affected joints, tendons, and/or ligaments.

# 285 Hz
This frequency is one of the well-known [Solfeggio frequencies](https://naturesoundretreat.com/solfeggio-frequency/), which were used in sacred music for its healing benefits. The 285-hertz frequency in specific has been implemented in order to help the healing and regeneration of tissues and organs through vibrational therapy.

They are believed to facilitate the body’s cellular regeneration processes, which are crucial for healing and recovering from injuries.

This healing frequency is often used in the treatment of burns, fractures, cuts, and other injuries as it effectively works to enhance the immune system.


# 396 Hz

The 396 hertz sound frequency is another significant healing frequency that has been associated with the suppression and elimination of negative emotions and fear responses.

**This specific frequency is believed to be useful in the alleviation of guilt and related guilty feelings, in order to promote acceptance and inner peace.**

396-hertz frequencies balance the root chakra (base of the spine), while helping to transform negative emotions into positive ones.
# 417 Hz

 this one is less focused on the healing of physical injuries or issues, but instead helps remove negative energy and dissolve emotional blockages.


This frequency has been implemented in therapy sessions that aim to address negative emotions and energy associated with traumatic events or stressful occurrences in one’s past.

# 432 Hz
create healing vibrations for the mind, body and spirit


It has been proven that 432Hz and 528Hz are woven together mathematically.


in the traditional Bel Canto technique, passed on through centuries from the Italian masters there is a specific shift in the registers of the voices of the tenors and sopranos. This naturally occurs on the F# when instruments are tuned to A = 432 Hz. When instruments are tuned to 440 Hz or higher then the shift will occur around the note F, or even lower. 


A very peculiar association I have encountered more than once is that with the name of Pythagoras. I was quite surprised to find the note A = 432 Hz addressed as ‘Pythagorean tuning’.


The Pythagorean tuning system is based on a cycle of ‘pure fifths’ (the 3/2 ratio found in the harmonic series). This tuning is not the one commonly in use today and one of the reasons is because a full cycle of 12 fifths should coincide with 7 octaves, but it actually doesn’t. The difference between the note we land on after stacking 12 fifths and the one we land on after 7 octaves is known as ‘Pythagorean comma’ (ratio 531441:524288).




 C = 256 Hz seems to be considered a ‘scientific tuning’.



In his article “_The Curious Concert Pitch Conflict_”, John Stuart Reid reports that the scientific pitch was set to C = 256 Hz in 1713 by French physicist Joseph Sauveur. Sauveur originally proposed this as a standard concert pitch due to the fact that all of its 8 musical octaves would result in whole numbers (32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096). (1) This was not accepted by the music world but it was instead adopted by the medical community and became known as ‘scientific pitch’.





A more daring chapter in the same book suggests parallels between voice registration and astronomical ratios in the Solar System: “F# is located as the geometrical mean of C 256 Hz and its octave, C 512 HZ. […] In physical terms, the register shift constitutes a singularity, a non linear phase change comparable to the transformation from ice to water or water to steam. […] Our Solar System also makes a ‘register shift’. It has long been noted that the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) all share such common features as relatively small size, solid silico-metallic surface, few moons and no rings. The outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) share a second, contrasting set of characteristics: large size, gaseous composition, many moons and rings. The dividing point between these two sharply contrasting ‘registers’ is the asteroid belt, a ring-like system of tens of thousands of fragmentary bodies believed to have arisen from an exploded planet. […] The Solar System register shift falls exactly in the same geometric mean position as the shift of the soprano voice in the proper C 256 Hz tuning.” (2)


 “living tissues emits and absorbs electromagnetic radiation at a series of specific frequencies or wavelenghts. It turns out that the most important of these frequencies can be arranged in an ordering very similar to the musical scale, but 42 octaves higher. […] the band of absorption of DNA corresponds to wavelenghts between 263 and 269 nanometers (a nanometer is one-billionth of a metre). The centre frequency of this band (corresponding to 265 nm) is 1.1283 x 10 to a power of 15 cycles per second, which is exactly 42 octaves above the frequency 256,54 cycles per second”. (4)




Founded by Rudolf Steiner in the early 20th century, Anthroposophy is a ‘spiritual philosophy’ that promotes the knowledge of the existence of an objective spiritual reality that can be experienced directly through personal inner development.

 I read that Steiner was once asked which is the correct pitch for our present; his answer was that “C = 128 Hz = Sun” was the correct pitch for modern human minds and spirits. C = 128 Hz is an octave lower than C = 256 Hz. Steiner is also said to have stated that the inner ear of the human being is built on C = 128 Hz. This frequency, according to Steiner, “not only relates to the planet Mars and its metal iron but also to meteoric iron as Sun substance in the cosmos, to Michael [Archangel] as the spirit of the age, to human blood and human freedom”. (5)


 256 (or its lower octave 128) Hz and 432 Hz. 


the equally tempered scale is a compromise with significant losses in terms of purity of harmony. She came up with a tuning system that she named the scale of twelve fifths that provided a way of tuning a piano with more acceptable compromises than equal temperament. (6) Using this system it is possible to have both C = 256 Hz and A = 432 Hz in the scale whereas this is not possible with equal temperament.


Maria Renold conducted many experiments, testing the different response of listeners to her tuning system both in 440 Hz standard pitch and 432 Hz. She “found that of 2000 people tested over 20 years, over 90% consistently preferred the lower pitch. The notes were given in different order, on different instruments, with various means to avoid prejudicing the listener. The wide variety of comments all went in the similar direction of calling the higher pitch more “irritating, unpleasant, aggressive, making one stressful and nervous”. The lower one, on the other hand, sounded “right, complete, pleasant, radiant, peaceful, harmonious, heartfelt but leaving one free.” (7)



It is a matter of fact that the number 432 is a special one. In fact, it can be found encoded in the knowledge of very ancient civilizations. It would be a mistake to believe that in ancient times the choice of numbers would happen randomly. There is evidence that very ancient inhabitants of the Earth possessed often a surprisingly high astronomical knowledge concerning the Earth, the Solar System and even distant stars.


The Hindu cosmology divides the cycles of time into four ‘yuga’ or ‘ages of the world’, The shorter of which (Kali yuga) is 432.000 years. Then we have the Dvāpara yuga of 864.000 years (432.000 x 2); the Tretā yuga of 1.296.000 years (432.000 x 3) and finally the Kṛta yuga of 1.728.000 years (432.000 x 4). The total sum is 4.320.000 years or Mahā yuga. In the Ṛg Veda, one of the sacred books of Hinduism, there are 432.000 syllables. “432.000 was also the number of years in the ancient Babylonian ‘Great year’. For the authors of the Grimnismal, 432.000 was the number of fallen warriors whom the Valkyries carried to Valhalla. For Ptolemy, 432.000 was the least common denominator for his monochord fractions”. (8)

The Borobudur Mahayana Buddhist temple in Indonesia (9th century) has 432 statues of the Buddha on one level and 72 more on an upper level. 432 is a multiple of 72 (6 octaves higher).

The diameter of the Sun is close to 864.000 miles (432.000 x 2); the diameter of the Moon is close to 2.160 miles (432.000 / 200). The Sun and the Moon appear the same size from the Earth, that’s why we can appreciate total solar eclipse. If expressed in metres (or any other measure other than inches, and miles) these numbers would not make much sense. But the inch seems to be a measurement unit that is closely related to astronomic, geophysical and mathematical proportions.



Now back to 432 Hz. When we speak about frequencies we speak about Hertz, which means cycles per seconds. When I first became interested in all of this, a legitimate doubt came into my mind: all these apparently significant frequencies only seem so special because we measure them in seconds, but is a second not an arbitrary unit?


 I wonder whether 7,2 could possibly have been the basic frequency of the Schumann resonance of the Earth in ancient times when all these units were created. 





Because of all the reasons above or others not mentioned in this article, there is a wide-spread trend on the internet that encourages people to convert their music the “healing” tuning of 432 Hz. The software Audacity, being free, is generally recommended to accomplish this task. Someone recently mentioned an iPhone app to me which converts any musical file directly while listening, simply by slowing it down enough to change the pitch from 440 to 432 Hz.


The first method is a very complex one. Modern software can work quite well on a monophonic input signal. Let’s say a song needs to be transposed in another key and the voice has already been recorded and cannot be re-made. In this case, pitch shifting the voice track alone can work quite well if one is happy with some very minute artifacts as a result. The same goes for any monophonic input such as a guitar solo, a violin or a bass, as long as the interval of the pitch shift is not too large. But changing the pitch of a whole stereo mix (e.g. a song) is another story. The resulting file will be full of artifacts like a sort of tremolo and something that sounds like phase shifting. If one is used to only listening to lowest quality mp3 files, they may not notice the difference because the original file is already intensely compromised. But if one aspires to a better listening experience then the effect of the pitch shift is not tolerable (I am assuming a basic understanding that anything below uncompressed audio files is really not advisable, or, if compression is necessary, at the VERY least 320kps mp3 files).


If we think in terms of resonance, we can picture how the frequencies we emit will resonate with everything they encounter. If the frequencies of the music we create are attuned with their higher and lower octaves in the space around us, then there is a reason to think that we are creating consonant flows of energy.

“The role of the composer is obvious […]: they are the alchemists who help to transmute the earth by making its substance and souls resonate with echoes of heavenly music. […] This is the accomplishment of the Great Work of musical alchemy, which, like alchemy proper, aims towards the redemption of all Nature as well as to the reunion of Man with his Overself.”  (9)








# 440 Hz
The 440 hertz sound frequency is a known healing frequency that has been implemented therapeutically to help with cognitive function and development.

Music that is tuned to this frequency has been called “cerebral” music, which refers to its effect on cognition and thought processes.

It is known to activate the third eye chakra, instead of the heart chakra which is associated with the quite similar 432-hertz frequency that we just talked about.

The third eye chakra is linked to perception and awareness, which correlates with the cerebral enhancement of this specific healing frequency.


The most interesting aspect of this experiment is that the 440 Hz music, which is today's music tuning standard, had very little to no stress-reducing effect.

# 444 Hz


# 528 Hz

This frequency is actually also known as the love frequency, and the musical tone is often called the “miracle note”. It has been associated with feelings of goodwill and blessings and has a history of being used in native and indigenous cultures for centuries.


**528 hertz is one of the more prominently recognized ancient Solfeggio frequencies and is believed to connect and resonate with the center of our being.**

From a scientific standpoint, the [528-hertz frequency](https://naturesoundretreat.com/528-hz/) has been shown to increase UV light absorption in DNA and acts to repair DNA by removing imperfections or issues that cause diseases and sickness.


 528 Hertz is a frequency that is central to the “musical mathematical matrix of creation.” More than any sound previously discovered, the “LOVE frequency” resonates at the heart of everything. It connects your heart, your spiritual essence, to the spiraling reality of heaven and earth.

He and his research partner, used the 528 Hz frequency and other Solfeggio tones to reduce the oil and grease in polluted waters (BP Oil Spill).






 A=444Hz tuning. He wrote that this 4 Hz higher pitch is more generally pleasing for musicians worldwide.


Recent research by veteran piano tuner and custom piano designer Daniel Koehler demonstrated the beneficial acoustic and spiritual impact of prototype pianos that include granite bridges to best accommodate the higher tension of strings tuned to A=444Hz. Koehler reported most enthusiastically that the 528 Hz frequency resonates most powerfully and enduringly.


528Hz is the bioenergy of health and longevity. It is the harmonic vibration that lifts your heart and divine voice in harmony with heaven.




This healing frequency helps you flow in perfect rhythm and harmony.

The capacity of structured water is generally overlooked in DNA to store and transmit [frequencies](https://naturesoundretreat.com/healing-frequencies/) that direct genetic expression and body repair. Musical mathematics energizes negatively charged electrons that prompt miracles.

The structure and color of chlorophyll best explains its function of generating oxygen, which is a natural cleansing and healing element central to water. The oxygen then broadcasts “electrons of love” that alkalize and energize cells and tissues.



 528 Hz is the “key of the house of David”. This is referring to David’s harp music, which was used to heal King Saul.
 
And the same love energy generated was used by Jesus to bring healing and miracles. Ultimately, that is what baptism is all about. It is spiritual renewal transmitting healing benefits.

believed to have a tremendous effect on the human body and is known as a naturally feel-good sound and contains the vibration needed for healing of the mind and body.

 528 Hz is central to everything in the universe and the “musical, mathematical matrix of creation”.


Its vibrations connect and resonate with everything within us and around us, on both a material and spiritual level.


1.  an extraordinary occurrence that surpasses all known human powers or natural forces and is ascribed to a divine or supernatural cause, esp. to God.
2.  a superb or surpassing example of something; wonder, marvel



The bees that pollinate many of these plants buzz around at 528 Hz. And the rainbow that completes this picturesque scene has 528 Hz at its heart as well, as it refracts the same greenish-yellow light found in chlorophyll.




*"Grass is green with LOVE/528. That is why chlorophyll is the most powerful healing pigment in biology. It's why people and animals eat grass to regain health, and why the air you breathe–the ‘prana’ of life, or the ‘chi’ in oriental medicine, is filled with the holy aloha spirit of LOVE. It vibrates in 528, sending spiritual signals for sustenance through your blood, restoring and invigorating every strand of DNA and cell in your body."

when recordings of the sun made by NASA scientists are compared to a tuning fork, we find 528 Hz there as well

## Human Case

In the 528 Hz condition, mean levels of cortisol significantly decreased, chromogranin A tended to decrease, and oxytocin significantly increased after music exposure. However, no significant change was observed in any salivary biomarkers in the 440 Hz condition.

The ratio of low frequency to high frequency autonomic nervous system activity significantly decreased after exposure to both types of music, and the coefficient of variation of R-R intervals also significantly decreased, but only after exposure to 528 Hz music.

Tension-anxiety and Total Mood Disturbance scores were significantly reduced after exposure to 528 Hz music, while there was no significant difference following 440 Hz music ([7](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327439522_Effect_of_528_Hz_Music_on_the_Endocrine_System_and_Autonomic_Nervous_System)).

The researchers concluded that 528 Hz music has an especially strong stress-reducing effect.


528 Hz has the ability to influence DNA on its own, as its effect on water helps heal DNA helix

> The 6-sided clear clusters that support the DNA double helix vibrate at a specific resonant frequency – 528 Hz ([8](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cUC_uFxBCjEC&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=Biochemist+Steve+Chemiski&source=bl&ots=9J3VYEko2n&sig=Geeu-C39TXl9s61o0bHAJyhtOUk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjyp4X73q7eAhXIKcAKHY3kAAAQ6AEwCnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=Biochemist%20Steve%20Chemiski&f=false)).

The late [Dr. Candice Pert,](http://candacepert.com/) an American neuroscientist and pharmacologist who discovered the opiate receptor, and the cellular binding site for endorphins in the brain, said that the energies and vibrations of these frequencies affect us on a cellular level, opening our chromosomes and exposing the DNA ([9](http://candacepert.com/)).


Victor Showell, a math scientist, has shown that 528 Hz is essential to the Pi, Phi, and Golden Mean that undergirds our natural world.

Dr. Horowitz once predicted that, “Musicians shall remedy what ails humanity”.









# 639 Hz


This healing frequency is associated with the [heart chakra](https://naturesoundretreat.com/heart-chakra-frequency/), like a number of the other frequencies in our review.


The 639-hertz frequency has been implemented in a variety of treatment plans and therapeutic sessions with the primary goal of facilitating positive emotions and good energy.

Studies have shown that exposure to this sound frequency has a role in the improvement of the listener’s situational awareness.




# 852 Hz


The healing benefits of the 852 hertz sound frequency are centered around the idea of redirecting the conscious mind away from stressful, invasive, and anxiety-driven thoughts that are unhealthy.


**These negative thought processes are known to contribute heavily to significant mental issues like anxiety and depression.**

focus on the alleviation of over-thinking tendencies and feelings of worry.





# 963 Hz


It is associated with activation of the crown chakra (located at the top of the head), and is believed to help clear mental fog while facilitating a connection with core feelings of humanity.

This particular frequency has been called the “frequency of the gods”, as it is said to help listeners establish a stronger and deeper connection with the divine.











# How To Tune


In music tuning to frequency means tuning one note on an instrument to that specific frequency. So if you tune your violin and for example to 440 Hz, then you are tuning the A string so that when played, IT vibrates at a frequency of 440 oscillations per second. And this, in turn, tunes the other strings so that they are in equal tempered tuning with the A string.



It is also said to help you flow in perfect rhythm and harmony. The 528 Hz frequency is the powerful sound of love and destroys human consciousness and brings more harmony and balance in life.

Ultimately, it helps to create self-love and end problems of hatred, illness, and jealousy in the world and is recommended for good, sound, and deep sleep.




 A tuned to 444 Hz, which coincides with C at 528 Hz.






528 frequency helps create these six-sided water clusters, as shown by the work of [Dr. Lee Lorenzen](http://engineeredlifestyles.com/cluster/story-of-clustered-water.html) – who discovered clustered healing water ([2](http://wonderwatersa.co.za/science/)).

When we expose normal water to 528 Hz, it begins to vibrate in synchronicity and thus forms the crystal-shaped, energized water clusters that create DNA’s protective matrix.

Consider that the human body is composed of approximately 70% water, and at the cellular level it nears 90%.



If this frequency can positively affect cellular water clusters, then it has the potential to assist in removing impurities from the cells in your body, to create a healthier cellular environment capable of fighting off sickness and disease.


Along with 528 Hz’s 
effects
 on our DNA, it’s 
also
 worth looking at its potential use on our cells and cellular structure.


 The current results show that in IC50 of ethanol, the frequency of 528 Hz increased cells viability about 20% and the level of ROS production has been reduced up to 100%.

**Conclusion:** Therefore, the use of these sound waves can be useful to reduce the toxic effects of ethanol on astrocytes cells culture.

Listening to music tuned to the Solfeggio frequency of 528 Hz is associated with increased energy, clarity of mind, conscious awareness, awakened / activated creativity, and ecstatic states like deep inner peace and joy.
