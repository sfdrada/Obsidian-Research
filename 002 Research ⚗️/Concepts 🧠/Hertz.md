# Hertz 

1 – The term “Hz” (or Hertz, last name of German physicist Heinrich Rudolph Hertz). Simply put, Hz means nothing more than “times per second” and it is the measuring unit of vibration. The number of Hz indicates how many times in one second the full cycle of a certain vibration occurs: 1 Hz means once per second; 432 Hz means 432 times per second… and so on.
