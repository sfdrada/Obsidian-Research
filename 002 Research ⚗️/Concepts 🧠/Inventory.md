# Inventory


A menu or area of the screen where items collected by the player-character during the game can be selected.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#cite_note-Dille-15)Â This interface allows the player to retrieve single-use items for an instant effect or to equip the player-character with the item.
