# Inversion


Marcus Aurelius
 “premeditation of evils.”
The goal of this exercise was to envision the negative things that could happen in life.

The Stoics believed that by imagining the worst case scenario ahead of time, they could overcome their fears of negative experiences and make better plans to prevent them. While most people were focused on how they could achieve success, the Stoics also considered how they would manage failure.

inversion is a rare and crucial skill that nearly all great thinkers use to their advantage.



solve hard problems by following a strategy of _man muss immer umkehren_ or, loosely translated, “invert, always invert.”

 one of the best ways to clarify your thinking was to restate math problems in inverse form. He would write down the opposite of the problem he was trying to solve and found that the solution often came to him more easily.


Inversion is a powerful thinking tool because it puts a spotlight on errors and roadblocks that are not obvious at first glance.

Great thinkers, icons, and innovators think forward and backward. Occasionally, they drive their brain in reverse. ^e8fd3c


ambitious young people are often focused on how to achieve success. But billionaire investor Charlie Munger encourages them to consider the inverse of success instead.

“What do you want to avoid?” he asks. “Such an easy answer: sloth and unreliability. If you’re unreliable it doesn’t matter what your virtues are. You’re going to crater immediately. Doing what you have faithfully engaged to do should be an automatic part of your conduct. You want to avoid sloth and unreliability.”

 Sometimes it is more important to consider why people fail in life than why they succeed.

Leaders can ask themselves, “What would someone do each day if they were a terrible manager?” Good leaders would likely avoid those things.

You can learn just as much from identifying what doesn't work as you can from spotting what does. What are the mistakes, errors, and flubs that you want to avoid? Inversion is not about finding good advice, but rather about finding anti-advice. It teaches you what to avoid.

Imagine the most important goal or project you are working on right now. Now fast forward six months and _assume the project or goal has failed_.

This strategy is sometimes called the “kill the company” exercise in organizations because the goal is to spell out the exact ways the company could fail.

Most people want to get more done in less time. Applying inversion to productivity you could ask, “What if I wanted to decrease my focus? How do I end up distracted?” The answer to that question may help you discover interruptions you can eliminate to free up more time and energy each day.


**Blindly chasing success can have severe consequences, but preventing failure usually carries very little risk.


*“We should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of.”
-Marie Kondo*
he default should be to give anything away that does not “spark joy” in your life. This shift in mindset inverts decluttering by focusing on what you want to keep rather than what you want to discard.

**The key insight I'd like to point out here is the difference between focusing on getting better vs. not getting worse.**


## Two Paths To Improvement

The distinction we are making here is between improvement by addition vs. improvement by subtraction.

. Improvement by addition is focused on doing more of what does work: producing a faster car, creating a more powerful speaker, building a stronger table. Improvement by subtraction is focused on doing less of what doesn't work: eliminating mistakes, reducing complexity, and stripping away the inessential.

Our desire for that next level of performance causes us to disproportionately focus on the front end of the curve.

Subtraction is more practical than addition. This is true for two reasons.



First, it is often easier to eliminate errors than it is to master peak performance. By simply writing down every step of a process, you can often identify a few areas that can be reduced or eliminated altogether.

Second, improvement by subtraction does not require you to achieve a new level of performance. This method is about doing what you are capable of doing more frequently. It is about reducing the likelihood that you'll perform below your ability.
