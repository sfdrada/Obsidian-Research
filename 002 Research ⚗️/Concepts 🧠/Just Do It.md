# Just Do It


it’s easy to look at someone who is already doing it and then try to reverse engineer their strategy.
- Imperfect starts

But it’s equally important to remember that the systems, habits, and strategies that successful people are using today are probably not the same ones they were using when they began their journey.

What is optimal for them right now isn’t necessarily needed for you to get started. There is a difference between the two.


But comparing your current situation to someone who is already successful can often make you feel like you lack the required resources to get started at all. If you look at their optimal setup, it can be really easy to convince yourself that you need to buy new things or learn new skills or meet new people before you can even take the first step toward your goals.



Claiming that you need to “learn more” or “get all of your ducks in a row” [can often be a crutch](https://jamesclear.com/taking-action) that prevents you from moving forward on the stuff that actually matters.


But don’t let visions of what is optimal prevent you from getting started in the first place.
An imperfect start can always be improved, but obsessing over a perfect plan will never take you anywhere on its own.




 
 
 
 
 # Complete or Kill
 
 
 “complete or kill” mentality. But you can take the same approach to your goals, projects, and work.


If something is important to you, complete it. If not, kill it.


If you’re anything like me, then you probably have a bunch of half–finished, half–completed projects and ideas. You don’t need all of those loose ends.



 Fill your life with goals that are worth finishing and [eliminate the rest](https://jamesclear.com/pruning).



**If you commit to nothing, you’re distracted by everything.**


We all have things that we say are important to us.
do you make time for these goals above all else? Do your organize your day around accomplishing them?



**It doesn’t matter how long your goal will take, just get started.**

You won’t die if you fail, you’ll only learn.


you can always change your mind.
