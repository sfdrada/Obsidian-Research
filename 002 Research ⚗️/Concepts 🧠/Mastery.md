# Mastery 


Mastery through dedication, practice, trial & error, adaptation, and improvisation 
- unlearn bad behavior
- reinforce good behaviors
- Treat as ðŸŽ¨ & ðŸ”¬
- Be willing to 'fail' -> Grow from each opportunity
	- Let go of ego and embrace change

*"The hardest part of mastering a new skill isnâ€™t access to information or training. Nor is it the 10,000 hours of practice everyone thinks is required to master a new skill â€“itâ€™s letting go of old, ego-invested beliefs about oneself." -Robert Greene
