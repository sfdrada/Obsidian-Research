double jump

The action, when game mechanics allow, of a game character being able to execute two successive [jumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#jump), the second jump occurring in mid-air without coming into contact with anything. The player must then typically touch the ground before being able to jump again.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#cite_note-48)


down-but-not-out (DBNO)

A term for near-death state, typically found in team [battle royale games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#battle_royale_game), in which a player becomes incapacitated instead of dying after losing health points. Players in this state can be revived by teammates as long as they still have health.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#cite_note-49)[_[relevant?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Stay_on_topic "Wikipedia:Writing better articles")_]
