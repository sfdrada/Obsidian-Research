# Motion vs. Action
![[Motion VS. Action Chart.jpg]]


When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome.

Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself.


If motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we're making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn’t feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen. And that's the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.

It's easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you're still making progress.



Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.



When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result.



**Set a time to switch from motion to action
