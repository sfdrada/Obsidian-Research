# Motivation

common misconception that motivation arrives as a result of passively consuming a motivational video or reading an inspirational book.


Scientists define motivation as your general willingness to do something. It is the set of psychological forces that compel you to take action.


“At some point, the pain of _not_ doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it.”



In other words, at some point, it is easier to change than to stay the same
-  the essence of motivation.
- threshold

Every choice has a price, but when we are motivated, it is easier to bear the inconvenience of action than the pain of remaining the same.







Simply by writing down a plan that said exactly _when_ and _where_ they intended to exercise, the participants in Group 3 were much more likely to actually follow through.

 having a specific plan worked really well, but motivation didn't work at all

The researchers discovered that what pulls that desire out of you and turns it into real–world action isn't your level of motivation, but rather your plan for implementation.

**implementation intention** - A plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.
- a concrete plan of action.

“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”

Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.

I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

plan for unexpected situations by using the phrase, “If ____, then ____.”


But if you do plan out when and where you are going to perform a new behavior, your goal has a time and a space to live in the real world. This shift in perspective allows your environment to act as a cue for your new behavior.

planning out when and where you will perform a specific behavior turns your environment into a trigger for action. The time and place triggers your behavior, not your level of motivation.

Nearly all of the friction in a task is at the beginning. After you start, progress occurs more naturally.



## How To Get Motivated
Many people struggle to find the motivation they need to achieve the goals they want because they are wasting too much time and energy on other parts of the process.

If you want to make it easy to find motivation and get started, then it helps to automate the early stages of your behavior.

“If you waste resources trying to decide when or where to work, you’ll impede your capacity to do the work.”

Setting a schedule for yourself seems simple, but it puts your decision-making on autopilot by giving your goals a time and a place to live. It makes it more likely that you will follow through regardless of your motivation levels.

Routine


The power of a ritual, or what I like to call a [pre-game routine](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-get-motivated "pre-game routine"), is that it provides a mindless way to initiate your behavior. It makes starting your habits easier and that means following through on a consistent basis is easier.



The key to any good ritual is that it removes the need to make a decision:

You want starting a behavior to be easy and automatic so you have the strength to finish it when it becomes difficult and challenging.


There are three simple steps you can take to build better rituals and make motivation a habit.


**Step 1**: A good pre–game routine starts by being so easy that you can’t say no to it. You shouldn’t need motivation to start your pre–game routine.

If you can’t get motivated in the beginning, then you’ll find that motivation often comes after starting. That’s why your pre–game routine needs to be incredibly easy to start.


**Step 2**: Your routine should get you _moving_ toward the end goal.

A lack of mental motivation is often linked to a lack of physical movement.

**Step 3**: You need to follow the same pattern every single time.

Eventually, this routine becomes so tied to your performance that by simply doing the routine, you are pulled into a mental state that is primed to perform. You don’t need to know how to find motivation, you just need to start your routine.


your pre–game routine is basically creating a “reminder” for yourself. Your pre–game routine is the trigger that kickstarts your habit, even if you’re not motivated to do it.


when you don’t feel motivated, it’s often too much work to figure out what you should do next. When faced with another decision, you will often decide to just quit. However, the pre–game routine solves that problem because you know exactly what to do next. There’s no debating or decision making. Lack of motivation doesn't matter. You just follow the pattern.


I developed a pre–game routine that allowed me to perform well, regardless of whether I was motivated or not.
My pre-game routine started a cascade of internal events that pulled me into the right frame of mind and made it more likely that I would succeed.

Imagine if you had a routine that could pull you into “exercise mode” or “work mode”, no matter how little motivation you had at the start.


This is why it’s so critical to do your pre-game routine every time, not just when you’re struggling with a lack of motivation. These small behaviors reinforce your good habits and the feelings that come with them. Pretty soon, your pre-game routine will not only be a trigger that kickstarts your habit, but also a reminder of what you’re working towards and the type of person you are becoming.
## How To Stay Motivated


You have a chance of winning the match, but only if you really try. Your focus narrows, distractions fade away, and you find yourself fully invested in the task at hand. The challenge you are facing is “just manageable.” Victory is not guaranteed, but it is possible. Tasks like these, science has found, are the most likely to keep us motivated in the long term.


Human beings love challenges, but only if they are within the optimal zone of difficulty. Tasks that are significantly below your current abilities are boring. Tasks that are significantly beyond your current abilities are discouraging. But tasks that are right on the border of success and failure are incredibly motivating to our human brains. We want nothing more than to master a skill just beyond our current horizon.

 The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.


f you find yourself feeling unmotivated to work on a task, it is often because it has drifted into an area of boredom or been shoved into an area of great difficulty. You need to find a way to pull your tasks back to the border of your abilities where you feel challenged, but capable.

 facing an optimal challenge and receiving immediate feedback about the progress you are making toward that challenge are two of the most critical components of peak motivation.



## When Motivation Fades


### **Your Mind is a Suggestion Engine**

Consider every thought you have as a suggestion, not an order.

If I pause for a moment, however, I can discover new suggestions

none of these suggestions are orders. They are merely options. I have the power to choose which option I follow.

Maintain perspective. Your life is good and your discomfort is temporary. Step into this moment of discomfort and let it strengthen you.

*“Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.”
-Theodore Roosevelt*
We want our work to be helpful and respected, but we do not want to struggle through our work.

 We want the final result, but not the failed attempts that precede it. We want the gold, but not the grind.

I have never found myself feeling worse after the hard work was done.



Life is a constant balance between giving into the ease of distraction or overcoming the pain of discipline.


This moment when you don’t feel like doing the work? This is not a moment to be thrown away. This is not a dress rehearsal. This moment is your life as much as any other moment. Spend it in a way that will make you proud.



## Types Of Motivation


onsuming the success and ideas of others is **passive inspiration.**

You might learn something, but you don't actually have to do anything.



 it is through the process of **active inspiration** — the act of creating things, applying new ideas to our goals, and making mistakes — that we discover who we are and what is important to us.

active inspiration is what results in long—term passion and enthusiasm. Watching someone else's success might leave you feeling excited for a few minutes, but taking action and applying a new idea to your life will inspire you more than anything someone else could say.



*The inspiration is not the receiving of information. The inspiration is applying what you’ve received.  
—Derek Sivers*

If you come across a good idea, use it. We spend so much time trying to find more inspirational things to _consume_ that it can be easy for us to forget that the best form of inspiration comes from what we _create_.

The application of ideas will always be more powerful than the ideas themselves.
