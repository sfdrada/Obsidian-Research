# Neuro Field

It can encourage firmly entrenched brainwave patterns to become more flexible, or help build activity in areas that may be deficient.

The Neurofield uses a technique called neurosignaling.
- very similar to neurofeedback


It emits a tiny electric field (pEMF), at about the same field strength as a headphone speaker (or 20 million times weaker than medical brain stimulation). It does not induce a current into the brain or de-polarise neurones as the medical devices do.





The signal ‘mimics’ brainwave activity, subtly encouraging or disrupting specific brainwaves in specific areas. It exercises the brain to be more dynamic, and more responsive to neurofeedback.

The Neurofield is our preferred method for [Infra-Low](https://brainworksneurotherapy.com/infra-low-ilf-neurofeedback) frequency training ([brainwaves](https://brainworksneurotherapy.com/what-are-brainwaves) at less than .5Hz), allowing us to efficiently train the deep, underlying rhythms of the brain.
