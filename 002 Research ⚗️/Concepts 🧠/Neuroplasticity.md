# Neuroplasticity

With every repetition of a thought or emotion, we reinforce a neural pathway - and with each new thought, we begin to create a new way of being. These small changes, frequently enough repeated, lead to changes in how our brains work.

Neuroplasticity is the 'muscle building' part of the brain; the things we do often we become stronger at, and what we don’t use fades away. That is the physical basis of why making a thought or action over and over again increases its power. Over time, it becomes automatic; a part of us. We literally become what we think and do.


Connections within the brain are constantly becoming stronger or weaker, depending on what is being used.

Younger people change easily; their brains are very plastic. As we age change doesn't come as easily; the brain loses some of its plasticity and we become more fixed in how we think, learn, and perceive.


by harnessing neuroplasticity we can improve everything we do and think. [Neurofeedback](https://brainworksneurotherapy.com/what-is-neurofeedback) works with these fundamental principles of neuroplasticity to help you take control of your mind.


"The old adage was “practice makes perfect - use it or lose it”.  The 21st Century neuroscience version is "neurons that fire together, wire together - neurons that fire apart, wire apart".
