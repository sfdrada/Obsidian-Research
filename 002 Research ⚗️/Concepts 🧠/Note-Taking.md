	- Bunch concepts together > Order of information

- [[Passive Learning]] -> [[Active Learning]] -> Creation

- Concepts > Categories
	- [[First Principles]]
	- Specific categories w/o connections < Generalizing concepts w/ connections 
		- Less overlap & better understanding =  More ⌛ for doing > learning

- Optimized for brain behavior

- [[Parallel Processing]] > [[Sequential Processing]]

- The frame you put around a fact will change your perspective
	- Upgrade the system > Changing each individual action
