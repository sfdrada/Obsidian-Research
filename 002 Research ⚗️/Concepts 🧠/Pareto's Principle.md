# Pareto's Principle

Pareto found that the numbers were never quite the same, but the trend was remarkably consistent. The majority of rewards always seemed to accrue to a small percentage of people. This idea that a small number of things account for the majority of the results became known as the Pareto Principle or, more commonly, the 80/20 Rule.



Scientists refer to this effect as “accumulative advantage.” What begins as a small advantage gets bigger over time.

> Situations in which small differences in performance lead to outsized rewards are known as Winner-Take-All Effects.

 typically occur in situations that involve relative comparison, where your performance relative to those around you is the determining factor in your success.

Any decision that involves using a limited resource like time or money will naturally result in a winner-take-all situation.



being just a little bit better than the competition can lead to outsized rewards because the winner takes all. You only win by 1 percent or 1 second or 1 dollar, but you capture 100 percent of the victory. The advantage of being a little bit better is not a little bit more reward, but the entire reward. The winner gets one and the rest get zero.


Winner-Take-All Effects in individual competitions can lead to Winner-Take-Most Effects in the larger game of life.


What began as a small margin is starting to trend toward the 80/20 Rule.


The margin between good and great is narrower than it seems. What begins as a slight edge over the competition compounds with each additional contest.

Over time, those that are slightly better end up with the majority of the rewards. Those that are slightly worse end up with next to nothing. This idea is sometimes referred to as The Matthew Effect, which references a passage in The Bible that says, “For all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.”


Small differences in performance can lead to very unequal distributions when repeated over time. This is yet another reason [why habits are so important](https://jamesclear.com/habits)

 The people and organizations that can do the right things, more consistently are more likely to maintain a slight edge and accumulate disproportionate rewards over time.


You only need to be slightly better than your competition, but if you are able to maintain a slight edge today and tomorrow and the day after that, then you can repeat the process of winning by just a little bit over and over again. And thanks to Winner-Take-All Effects, each win delivers outsized rewards.


The 1 Percent Rule states that over time the majority of the rewards in a given field will accumulate to the people, teams, and organizations that maintain a 1 percent advantage over the alternatives.

the process of accumulative advantage is the hidden engine that drives the 80/20 Rule.



The 80/20 Rule is like a form of judo for life and work. By finding precisely the right area to apply pressure, you can get more results with less effort. It's a great strategy, and I have used it many times.



## When The Pareto's Principle Fails


### Efficient VS. Effective

How do you decide the best way to spend your time?


Efficiency is about getting more things done. Effectiveness is about getting the _right_ things done.

*“There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.”
-Peter Drucker*

making progress is not just about being productive. It's about being productive on the right things.


This is the downside of the 80/20 Rule: A new path will never look like the most effective option in the beginning.



The 80/20 Rule will help you find the useful things in your past and get more of them in the future. But if you don’t want your future to be more of your past, then you need a different approach.

The downside of being effective is that you often optimize for your past rather than for your future.

the thing that previously seemed ineffective can become very effective. You get good at what you practice.

The process of learning a new skill or starting a new company or taking on a new adventure of any sort will often appear to be an ineffective use of time at first. Compared to the other things you already know how to do, the new thing will seem like a waste of time. It will never win the 80/20 analysis.

But that doesn't mean it's the wrong decision.





take the steps and actions required to make your vision a reality.

what's the most important thing for you in this moment?


We need to get into the habit of putting first things first. Taking the time to focus on what really matters and focusing our efforts on what's going to get us to where we want to be in life. Really start questioning the scripts, the habits, in your life.


 Usually we all write things down on an endless to do list. We tend to go in order from top to bottom with no real priorities
