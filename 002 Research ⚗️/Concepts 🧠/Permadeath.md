# Permadeath

when a player must restart the game from the beginning when their character dies, instead of from a [saved game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#saved_game) or [save point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#save_point). This may also refer to the case of a player having to restart the game due to failing to meet a certain objective.
