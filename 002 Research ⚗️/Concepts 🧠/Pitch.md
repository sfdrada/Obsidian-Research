# Pitch

2 – The standard pitch (or reference pitch) for the intonation of musical instruments. In order to make it possible for many musicians to play together, a reference pitch or standard needs to be set. Currently, the international standard pitch (proposed in 1939, 1955 and finally adopted internationally in 1978) is A = 440 Hz, where A or _La_ (the Latin name for the same note) is the sixth note above the middle C (or _Do_) of a piano. It has been decided that this note has to vibrate 440 times per second. All the other notes of the scale will be then tuned accordingly.




Pitch refers to how high or low a note sounds. Specifically, pitch refers to the frequency of soundwaves your instrument or voice are producing. The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.
