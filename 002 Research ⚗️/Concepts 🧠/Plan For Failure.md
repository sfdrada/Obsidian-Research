# Plan For Failure

But once you realize the power of consistency, there is a danger that comes with this knowledge. And that danger is falling into an all-or-nothing mindset.


it can be easy to obsess over becoming flawlessly consistent.

 if you don’t follow perfectly, then you’ve failed.


 there is no safety margin for errors, mistakes, and emergencies.


Cutting yourself some slack becomes even more important when we consider the science behind [habit formation](https://jamesclear.com/habits) and continual improvement. Research shows that, regardless of the habit that you are working to build, missing a single day has no measurable impact on your long-term success. (

Consistency is essential for success in any area. There is no way to get around the fact that mastery requires a volume of work.


 if you want to maintain your sanity, reduce stress, and increase your odds of long-term success, then you need to plan for failure as well as focus on consistency.


the number one reason why willpower fades and people fail to remain consistent with their habits and goals is that they don't have plan for failure.


Planning to fail doesn’t mean that you expect to fail, but rather than you know what you will do and how you will [get back on track](https://jamesclear.com/get-back-on-track "get back on track") when things don’t work out

all-or-nothing trap.



 individual failures have little impact on your long-term success and a huge impact on your growth and ability to adapt



It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”


s, when you think about your goals, don't just consider the outcome you want. Focus on the repetitions that lead to that place.

setting up a system for putting your reps in is more important than choosing a goal.



The goal is just an event — something that you can't totally control or predict. But the reps are what can make the event happen. If you ignore the outcomes and focus only on the repetitions, you'll still get results. If you ignore the goals and build habits instead, the outcomes will be there anyway.
