# Power Creep

The gradual unbalancing of a game due to successive releases of new content. may refer to the result of repeatedly balancing a game primarily through [buffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#buff) and [nerfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#nerf), thus making every character substantially more powerful than they were at release.
