there are 2 ways to live life – you can either be reactive or proactive. 

Reactive people complain about things that are out of their control.

proactive. This type of person realizes that their decisions determine their life, not their conditions. Proactive people don't complain about things they can't control. Additionally, they take action to improve the things that they can control.


 we may not have complete control over certain outside forces, but we can control how we respond to a situation.
