# Procrastination

During our more productive moments, when we temporarily figure out how to stop procrastinating, we feel satisfied and accomplished.

the science behind why we procrastinate

**Akrasia** The state of acting against your better judgment. It is when you do one thing even though you know you should do something else.

the act of delaying or postponing a task or set of tasks.


the force that prevents you from following through on what you set out to do.

living a life based on what you should do leads to a life of insincerity 
- less desire = more pain

## Why Do We Procrastinate

Behavioral psychology research has revealed a phenomenon called “time inconsistency,” which helps explain why procrastination seems to pull us in despite our good intentions. Time inconsistency refers to the tendency of the human brain to value immediate rewards more highly than future rewards.


 Researchers have found that when you think about your Future Self, it is quite easy for your brain to see the value in taking actions with long-term benefits. The Future Self values long-term rewards.


Researchers have discovered that the Present Self really likes instant gratification, not long-term payoff.


So, the Present Self and the Future Self are often at odds with one another.

Your brain values long-term benefits when they are in the future (tomorrow), but it values immediate gratification when it comes to the present moment (today).



You cannot rely on long-term consequences and rewards to motivate the Present Self. Instead, you have to find a way to move future rewards and punishments into the present moment. You have to make the future consequences become present consequences.

This is exactly what happens during the moment when we finally move beyond procrastination and take action.

 As soon as you cross the Action Line, the pain begins to subside. In fact, being in the middle of procrastination is often _more painful_ than being in the middle of doing the work


The guilt, shame, and anxiety that you feel while procrastinating are usually worse than the effort and energy you have to put in while you're working

The problem is not _doing_ the work, it's _starting_ the work.



## How To Stop Procrastinating

1. Make the Rewards of Taking Action More Immediate
	- easier to avoid procrastination.

One of the best ways to bring future rewards into the present moment is with a strategy known as temptation bundling.

 bundle a behavior that is good for you in the long-run with a behavior that feels good in the short-run.


The basic format is: Only do [THING YOU LOVE] while doing [THING YOU PROCRASTINATE ON].


2. Make the Consequences of Procrastination More Immediate

put some skin in the game and create a new consequence that happens if you don't do the behavior right now.


3.  Design Your Future Actions


“commitment device.” Commitment devices can help you stop procrastinating by designing your future actions ahead of time.



4. Make the Task More Achievable

the friction that causes procrastination is usually centered around starting a behavior

Once you begin, it’s often less painful to keep working

[[5 Minute Rule]]


Once you start doing something, it’s easier to continue doing it.


Another great way to make tasks more achievable is to break them down.


Making your tasks more achievable is important for two reasons.
1.  Small measures of progress help to maintain momentum over the long-run, which means you’re more likely to finish large tasks.
2.  The faster you complete a productive task, the more quickly your day develops an attitude of productivity and effectiveness.

I have found this second point, the speed with which you complete your first task of the day, to be of particular importance for overcoming procrastination and maintaining a high productive output day after day.



### Ivy Lee Method


One of the best productivity systems I have found is also one of the most simple. It's called [The Ivy Lee Method](https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee) and it has six steps:

1.  At the end of each work day, write down the six most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow. Do not write down more than six tasks.
2.  Prioritize those six items in order of their true importance.
3.  When you arrive tomorrow, concentrate only on the first task. Work until the first task is finished before moving on to the second task.
4.  Approach the rest of your list in the same fashion. At the end of the day, move any unfinished items to a new list of six tasks for the following day.
5.  Repeat this process every working day.

In my experience, complexity is often a weakness because it makes it harder to [get back on track](https://jamesclear.com/get-back-on-track). Yes, emergencies and unexpected distractions will arise. Ignore them as much as possible, deal with them when you must, and get back to your prioritized to-do list as soon as possible. Use simple rules to guide complex behavior.



**It forces you to make tough decisions.**


 the single best thing to do when you have too many ideas (or when you’re overwhelmed by everything you need to get done) is to [prune your ideas](https://jamesclear.com/pruning) and trim away everything that isn’t absolutely necessary


Lee’s method forces you to decide on your first task the night before you go to work.

Modern society loves multi-tasking. [The myth of multi-tasking](https://jamesclear.com/multitasking-myth) is that being busy is synonymous with being better. The exact opposite is true. Having fewer priorities leads to better work.

You can’t be great at one task if you’re constantly dividing your time ten different ways

 Do the most important thing first each day and let the momentum of the first task carry you into the next one.



Another way to overcome the trap of chronic procrastination is to use visual cues to [trigger your habits](https://jamesclear.com/habit-triggers) and [measure your progress](https://jamesclear.com/measuring).

**Visual cues remind you to start a behavior.**
**Visual cues display your progress on a behavior.**
**Visual cues can have an additive effect on motivation.**


The more visual progress you see, the more motivated you will become to finish the task.




### Seinfeld Strategy


. Wanting to achieve our goals, but — for some reason or another — we still procrastinate on them.

_He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker. He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day._

_“After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job is to not break the chain.”_



It didn’t matter if he was motivated or not. It didn’t matter if he was writing great jokes or not. It didn't matter if what he was working on would ever make it into a show. All that mattered was “not breaking the chain.”


The Seinfeld Strategy works because it helps to take the focus off of each individual performance and puts the emphasis on the process instead. It’s not about how you feel, how inspired you are, or how brilliant your work is that day. Instead, it’s just about “not breaking the chain.”


There is one caveat with the Seinfeld Strategy. You need to pick a task that is meaningful enough to make a difference, but simple enough that you can get it done.

a sustainable chain


focus on actions and not motions


 Mastery follows consistency.





### Newton's 3 Laws Of Productivity

**First Law of Motion:** An object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.

Once you get started, it is much easier to stay in motion.
[[5 Minute Rule]]


**Second Law of Motion:** F=ma. The vector sum of the forces on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by the acceleration vector of the object.



The force, F, is a vector. Vectors involve both magnitude (how much work you are putting in) and direction (where that work is focused). In other words, if you want to get an object accelerating in a particular direction, then the size of the force you apply and the direction of that force will both make a difference.


If you want to be productive, it's not merely about how hard you work (magnitude), it's also about where that work is applied (direction). This is true of big life decisions and small daily decisions.



**Third Law of Motion:** When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.


If we want to become more effective and more productive, then we have two choices.

The first option is to add more productive force. This is the “power through it” option. We gut it out, drink another cup of coffee, and work harder. This is why people take drugs that help them focus or watch a motivational video to pump themselves up. It's all an effort to increase your productive force and overpower the unproductive forces we face.

Obviously, you can only do this for so long before you burn out, but for a brief moment the “power through it” strategy can work well.

The second option is to eliminate the opposing forces.

If you reduce the unproductive forces in your life, your productivity will glide forward naturally. It's like you magically remove the hand that has been holding you back.


 I find it to be much less stressful to cut out the opposing forces and let your productivity naturally flow forward.
