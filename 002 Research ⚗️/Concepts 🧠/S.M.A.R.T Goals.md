![[System VS. Goal.jpg]]

**Goal** An accomplishment to reach the objective
**System** The strategy you apply to get the objective


Results are 70% Systems & 30% Goals

## Winners and losers have the same goals.
Goal setting suffers from [[Survivorship Bias]]


## Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.

 change the systems that cause bad results.


When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.


## Goals restrict your happiness.

 “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.”
you’re continually putting happiness off

 goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment

 It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.

 When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.


## Goals are at odds with long-term progress.

When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?
This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.


True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.





___
goals are good for _planning_ your progress and systems are good for actually _making_ progress.

## Measuring Goals

I measure progress backward (_What happened in my business this week?_) and use that backward measurement as a way to guide my actions for the next week.

 I measure backward and use that measurement to determine my next move. I am constantly looking to improve, but I base my choices on what has recently happened, not on what I hope will happen in the future.

*The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.
—Samuel Johnson



measuring backward can call attention to these invisible patterns by making you aware of what you are actually doing. Measuring backward forces you to take notice of your recent actions.

 You have to look at the feedback of what has recently happened in your life and then base your decisions and improvements on those pieces of data.




*The best way to change long-term behavior is with short-term feedback.  
—Seth Godin*

There is one caveat to this strategy: when you measure backward, your data needs to come from the recent past.





. When you measure backward, you get to enjoy the progress you are making right now rather than yearn for a different life in the future.


Focusing on how you can immediately improve over your past self is more satisfying that comparing your current state to where you hope you'll be some day.


















1.  Focus: You can't be good at everything and it's hard to be great at more than one thing, so pick the one thing you're going to become great at and focus on it.
2.  Consistency: Focus is useless if you're only focused every now and then. It's showing up time after time that makes the difference.
3.  Patience: If you're focused and consistent, then let time work for you. Results will come when they come. Focus on the system, not the goal.


## Setting Goals

Using this one basic idea, I have made consistent progress on my goals every single week without incredible doses of [willpower](https://jamesclear.com/willpower) or remarkable [motivation](https://jamesclear.com/motivation).


there is one common mistake we often make when it comes to [setting goals](https://jamesclear.com/goal-setting). 
The problem is this: we set a deadline, but not a schedule.

The problem with this is that if we don't magically hit the arbitrary timeline that we set in the beginning, then we feel like a failure … even if we are better off than we were at the start. The end result, sadly, is that we often give up if we don't reach our goal by the initial deadline.

In my experience, a better way to achieve your goals is to set a schedule to operate by rather than a deadline to perform by.
Instead of giving yourself a deadline to accomplish a particular goal by (and then feeling like a failure if you don’t achieve it), you should choose a goal that is important to you and then set a schedule to work towards it consistently.

**Focus on the Practice, Not the Performance

 I made consistent progress towards my goals not by setting a deadline for my performance, but by sticking to a schedule.

The strange thing is that for top performers, it’s not about the performance, it’s about the continual practice.




The real challenge is not determining if you want the result, but if you are willing to accept the sacrifices required to achieve your goal. Do you want the lifestyle that comes with your quest? Do you want the boring and ugly process that comes before the exciting and glamorous outcome?

Goal setting is not only about choosing the rewards you want to enjoy, but also the costs you are willing to pay.

Goals are useful for setting the direction. Systems are great for actually making progress. In fact, the primary benefit of having a goal is that it tells you what sort of system you need to put in place. However, the system itself is what actually achieved the results.

**Goal Competition** - One of the greatest barriers to achieving your goals is the other goals you have.

Sometimes you just need to reorganize your priorities a little bit and suddenly progress comes much more quickly because you are now fully committed to a goal that was only getting moderate attention previously.

What often looks like a problem of goal _setting_ is actually a problem of goal _selection_. What we really need is not bigger goals, but better focus. You need to choose one thing and ruthlessly eliminate everything else.

![[Long Term Growth Chart.jpg]]

You want to push hard enough to make progress, but not so much that it is unsustainable. This is where setting an upper limit can be useful. Upper limits make it easier for you to sustain your progress and continue showing up.

if you don't build the habit of showing up, then you'll never have anything to improve in the future.

**Opt-Out vs. Opt-In.** - Opting your future self into better habits ahead of time. 
- More effective when opting in in a good state


The trick is to realize that counting, measuring, and tracking is not about the result. Measure to discover, to find out, to understand. Measure to see if you are showing up.Measure to see if you're actually spending time on the things that are important to you.






## How To Stick To Goals

The chaos and unpredictability of life is one of the factors that makes sticking to your goals difficult.

“Don't tell me that the circumstances aren't ideal. Tell me that you're going to make it your responsibility to be better prepared next time.”

**Reduce The Scope, Stick To The Schedule

The basic idea is that on any given day it is more important to stick to your schedule than it is to meet your expectations.


**If-Then Technique

Because it forces you to create a strategy for reducing the scope, but sticking to the schedule _before_ you actually need to do so.

“If [something unexpected], then [your response].”

The If-Then Technique forces you to consider the unpredictable circumstances that so often enter our daily lives. And that means you have fewer excuses for doing nothing and more options for sticking to your goals.





### Master 1 Thing @ A Time

even if we are committed to working hard on our goals, our natural tendency is to revert back to our old habits at some point. Making a permanent lifestyle change is really difficult.

Research has shown that you are 2x to 3x more likely to stick with your habits if you make a specific plan for when, where, and how you will perform the behavior.



When you begin practicing a new habit it requires a lot of conscious effort to remember to do it. After awhile, however, the pattern of behavior becomes easier. Eventually, your new habit becomes a normal routine and the process is more or less mindless and automatic.

**Automaticity** - Ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which allows the pattern to become automatic and habitual.

automaticity only occurs as the result of lots of repetition and practice.
After 30 days, the habit is becoming fairly routine.
After 60 days, the process is about as automatic as it can become.
1.  You are 2x to 3x more likely to follow through with a habit if you make a specific plan for when, where, and how you are going to implement it. This is known as an implementation intention.
2.  You should focus entirely on one thing. Research has found that implementation intentions do not work if you try to improve multiple habits at the same time.
3.  Research has shown that any given habit becomes more automatic with more practice. On average, it takes at least two months for new habits to become automatic behaviors.

The counterintuitive insight from all of this research is that the best way to change your entire life is by not changing your entire life. Instead, it is best to focus on one specific habit, work on it until you master it, and make it an automatic part of your daily life. Then, repeat the process for the next habit.
