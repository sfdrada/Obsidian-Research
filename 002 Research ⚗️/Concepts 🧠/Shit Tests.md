# Shit Tests

Women test you to check your strength
- only do this when you are messing up?
- Reinforces [[Masculinity]] & [[Femininity]] polarity



"There's an attitude to take with super HB's (and all women really) that is pure gold. The thought is that "INSTINCTUALLY women KNOW their role." 
- on an "instinctual" level women ARE all the same! They get their juices flowing when they are in the presence of a MAN who is living HIS ROLE. MAN is the dominant one, NOT woman. And deep down inside women KNOW this. This has NOTHING to do with being an asshole. This is about being a MAN who is NOT afraid

You have to be the MAN who has all the sexual power. And when a woman (no matter how hot) sees and feels the presence of a man whom she recognizes as the dominant one while SHE isn't, she does what every woman does - that is SURRENDERS to the more powerful being. And all that acting like she's hot and knows she's the stuff and all those other "head up in the air" tricks are just a test and a way to weed out all the men who are less powerful than her and don't know their role as a MAN."
