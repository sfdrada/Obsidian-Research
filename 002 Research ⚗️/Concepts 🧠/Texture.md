# Timbre

Texture is used to describe how the tempo, harmonic, and melodic materials are created in a composition to determine the quality of sound in the piece. There are many layers to every song, even the simplest sounding ones. Layers of instruments and vocals come together to create the texture. More instruments and voices often make a thicker texture while fewer makes a thinner texture. There are different types of musical textures including monophonic, biphonic, and homophonic.
