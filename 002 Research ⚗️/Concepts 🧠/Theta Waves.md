# Theta Waves

## Theory


![[Theta Wave.gif]]
  lightly sleeping (theta brainwaves)

 occur naturally during light sleep including the REM (rapid eye movement) sleep state.

 restorative sleep, there are health benefits of being in a deliberate Theta state including improved physical healing, release of hormones to promote health and longevity, as well as a reduction in stress and mental tiredness.

Inducing a Theta brainwave state can help you get off to sleep and reduce the time you need to be asleep.


A goal of meditators is to achieve a Theta state while awake and practiced, long term meditators describe a trance-like state where they feel their mind has gone to sleep but they are aware of their surroundings.
- They describe it as prolonged daydreaming and find that they have no awareness of time while in this state. They often get closer to their emotions and feel them more fully.

 deep relaxation, heightened intuition and inspiration and profound creativity.

both sides of your brain are in sync and whole-brain use is achievable. Many meditators have psychic or paranormal experiences whilst in this state and many claim a spiritual experience of being connected with the world.

Theta brainwaves are the dominant brainwave pattern in most children and teenagers


mall periods of Theta brainwaves (20-30 minutes per day) can be very beneficial but we shouldn’t overdo it while we are awake.

 Theta is our gateway to learning, memory, and intuition. In theta, our senses are withdrawn from the external world and focused on signals originating from within. It is that twilight state which we normally only experience fleetingly as we wake or drift off to sleep. In theta we are in a dream; vivid imagery, intuition and information beyond our normal conscious awareness. It’s where we hold our ‘stuff’, our fears, troubled history, and nightmares.
