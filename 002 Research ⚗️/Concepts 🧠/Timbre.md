# Timbre

Timbre also references the quality of different sounds. It is easily one of the most distinguishable characteristic of a type of sound aside from the pitch and loudness. Simply put, it’s the difference in timbre that helps you identify a flute from a cello, even when they are playing the same pitch. It is one of the broadest designations a sound can have and identifies the most obvious characteristics of a sound. Words like “tinny, dark, and bright” are common ways to describe the timbre of the sound.
