# Tonal Systems

3 – Tonal systems. A tonal system is a framework made of a series of tones arranged in specific ratios. In order to make music, we arrange the notes of the musical scale in a way as to create specific _intervals_ (combinations of two notes) from which we proceed to create _chords_ (combinations of three or more notes) by which we express and experience ‘harmony’. There are several different tonal systems and the one we are more familiar with in the western culture is the 12 tones _Equal Temperament_, which sets a musical scale of 12 notes. The distance between any one of these notes from the next or the previous is constant.
