# Tone

Tone is an aspect of the quality of a sound identified regularity in its vibrations. Simple tones only have one frequency, an example would be the sound made by a tuning fork. Complex tones have a couple of simple tones, known as partial tones. As a tone gets more complex, you end up with overtones. We will discuss those later on.
