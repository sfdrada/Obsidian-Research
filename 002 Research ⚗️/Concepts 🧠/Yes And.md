# Yes And

**Yes** I agree with the world as it is **And** Here is some value from me
- say phrase without thinking ahead
	- prevents your brain from avoiding 'embarrassment' from silence
- trust yourself to come up with something
- generates something value offering
	- works great w/ hard conversations
	- Passes shit tests w/ [[Agree & Exaggerate]]

Yes And != Yes But

Most guys only ask questions (value taking)
and never putting in their own input (value offering)

## How To Practice
1. Yes and off another person or each other
2. Yes and yourself
3. Yes and the context around you
