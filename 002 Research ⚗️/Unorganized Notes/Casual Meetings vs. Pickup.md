Girls love to meet their prince charming casually, they dream of meeting you accidentally and by chance.+



That is also why trying to pick up a girl in the street or on the commuter is so much harder to do than just “meeting her casually” – it is completely different from what she has been dreaming of and in addition to having to make her like you the way you present yourself, you’ll have to compensate for not being able to have the silent recommendation of having mutual friends or hobbies plus dismiss any of her doubts of you “doing this (picking up girls) all the time”,





 you’ll be using the same techniques nevertheless. Opting for a casual meeting just simplifies your task of getting her to like you and has a higher probability of her coming to expect a LTR once things get serious


casual meetings are safe, pick-ups more rewarding
