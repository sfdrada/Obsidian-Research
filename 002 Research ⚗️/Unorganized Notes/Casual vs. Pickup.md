Girls love to meet their prince charming casually, they dream of meeting you accidentally and by chance



Trying to pick up a girl in the street or on the commuter is so much harder to do than just “meeting her casually”
- Completely different from what she has been dreaming of 
- Having to make her like you the way you present yourself
	- Not through connections, friends, hobbies, etc.
- dismiss her doubts of you “doing this (picking up girls) all the time”


**you’ll be using the same techniques nevertheless


A casual meeting simplifies your task of getting her to like you and has a higher probability of her coming to expect a LTR once things get serious

pick-ups are tougher to pull off successfully, but they also broaden your choice of girls far beyond those that you happen to meet “casually” plus each failure and succcess will build your experience and confidence respectively far more than casual meetings could ever do.
