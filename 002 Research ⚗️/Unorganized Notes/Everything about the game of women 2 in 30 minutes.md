2. Risk losing you


You had 1 you had them all

What did love get you?
- going online to look be better to find love again
	- chasing the wrong thing

Guys want a woman and still be able to do what they want to do.

Girls want a guy and still be able to do what they want to do

You become what you attract

People are seasons

Do whatever you want to do when you feel like it

Make it seem like you need her



# Girlfriend

If you're in a relationship and having problems, start hanging out with her less and do more cool things


Women have to wonder about you

**Make her think something is up to make her step her game up to get the validation that she's used to getting from you
- Get them to chase the validation instead of keeping them around by spending money on them
	- Has to see you as higher value than her
- 



She has to think you get other women

If a woman doesn't respect you, you have no power

Women are uncooperateive, bitchy, and untolerable because they are BORED

	- Give them a scarcity mindset
