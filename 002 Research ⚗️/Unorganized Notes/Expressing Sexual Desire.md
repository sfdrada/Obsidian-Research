# Expressing Sexual Desire

The point of seduction is to make the girl want you
- It's not about whether or not to express yourself, but rather how to get her as infatuated as possible
	- She won't be able to resist her emotions and you

"Don't rush things sexually with single women. Appear as if you are still deciding whether or not you want to be involved (Be the leader)."
- if the mood, the time, the place isn't right, or it feels the slightest bit awkward, don't try kissing her for the first time.
	- If she's interested, the time and place will come.
- Without situational awareness, pushing can appear desperate and inexperienced 

you are a MAN, you DO have sexual desires, no point in trying to deny that. Which... in fact is a good attitude to have
- Â if some girl wrinkles her nose at this - you'll just convert her and she won't know how she could ever have thought differently from you

Women want exciting, provocative, imaginative partners who will lead them through great sexual experiences.

Though their sexual desire may be very high, they will pass up just any sexual encounter waiting to find the one that promises to be special.
