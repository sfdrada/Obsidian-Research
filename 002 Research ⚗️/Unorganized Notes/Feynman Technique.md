# Feynman Technique




1. Select an interest or concept you want to learn and learn about it
	1. Optionally take notes
2. Write down everything you know on paper
	1. Find gaps in your information
3. Go back and fill in gaps 
4. Reorganize/Restructure in a way others can understand


The material that you study from beats the method that you study with

Avoid sunk costs
- information you don't need to consume
- Not useful at the moment 
- Superficial reading
