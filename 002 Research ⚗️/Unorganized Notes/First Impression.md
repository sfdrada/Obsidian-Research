In general, a woman makes a decision about whether or not she would like to sleep with a man very early during a first encounter.
- That is why acting like a desperate and horny or a simply nice and wimpy AFC yields you nothing.



if a woman has decided that she is not interested in sleeping with you, no amount of pursuit or persuasion is going to move her.


Should you be able to leave your old AFC habits behind and become a man, she won't be able to hold on to her old beliefs about you. Now that you're different and can make her feel different, present yourself to her anew and watch the fireworks
- considerably more effort on your part than if you had left the right impression on her the first time around



your options are much more varied - maybe she just didn't like the approach you used, no problem, try another one, or maybe you simply weren't at your best, next time you meet, she has a chance to reevaluate her position
