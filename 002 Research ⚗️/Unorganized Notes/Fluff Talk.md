Can't simply begin a conversation with [[Patterns]]

**Girls want to be programmed

Fluff talk is also needed, if you plan to continue with eliciting values – you must have had at least some sort of a casual conversation with the girl, for then it would sound only natural for you to have become a little more interested in her, to the point of asking all sorts of questions

The number one rule of fluff talk is – direct the conversation towards and talk about FEELINGS.
- Facts are a BORE! Giving you her facts makes her feel NOTHING.
- She has no use for random facts you are giving her. So grab any opportunity you have to get to feelings!


Fluff Talk -> Pattern
=
Example:

“So what did you do yesterday?”

“Oh I went skating”

“You like skating?”

“Yes:)”

“Makes you feel good?:)”

“Yeah:)”

“I know what you mean…”

And you go on to describe skating as the most liberating, beautiful, earth-shattering experience (that’s what making up patterns on the fly is all about:). Or have her describe you her feelings herself, if she is a talker. Voila – you’ve switched from fluff talk to patterning in a blink of an eye:)


So let the the fluff talk continue.

“So… em… have you eaten anything today?”

“Yea, some sandwitches in the morning. Why?”

“Well I was just hoping to pick up on some tips on how to have a delicious breakfast without having to spend too much time making it:) So you like sandwitches?”

“Um… not really:) I just don’t have time for much anything else:)”

“But if you did, let’s say you had your own personal cook, what would you like to start your morning with?”

“Oh, well (salivating:), fried eggs and bacon, and a large cup of hot chocolate, and some marmalade (etc, let her describe it to her heart’s content:)”

“Ah, that would really feel good wouldnÂ´t it? Still lazily laying in your bed, to have all that delicious food brought to you on a silver tray – you take a sip of cocoa and can feel the pleasant warmth of it spreading thorughout your body, which after a good-night’s sleep is more fresh and receptive to the pleasentness of that feeling than usual, and you take a taste of marmalade and can feel it melting in your mouth and the sweetness of it waking you up for yet another wondeful day (etc, now make good use of all the food she HERSELF told you she likes:)”

Once again – fluff talk to pattern talk in no time:)


“”So, what’s *your* story?” – this is wonderful question that will get the other party talking. It’s a good intro, or it can be used right after an opening line.
- rapport material
	- Gives the opportunity to share personal information w/o being forced
- Can be used with any interesting observation
	- clothes
	- accessories

Always be prepared to mirror the statements they give you … if they reveal something personal about themselves, you can reveal something that’s personal to you
- good time to start your [[Patterns]]


if things aren’t progressing so well with one person, remember that mingling means moving around … don’t stay with one person so long, otherwise you’re not mingling. You can always return later.


## Don'ts:
-   Do not talk about any of your personal (family, work, money) problems.
-   Don’t act desperate.
-   Don’t talk about anything negative at all. Keep everything you talk about upbeat and positive.
-   Don’t get drunk. This really turns women off and makes a bad impression. Don’t drink at all or limit your drinking to a couple of drinks.
-   Don’t try to analyse her problems.
-   Don’t bitch about your previous girlfriends or ex-wives on how they mistreated you, dumped you, cheated on you, took you to the cleaners on child support, etc.
-   Don’t pretend to be funny or humorous. If you are putting on an act, it will come across to her as phoney. Just be friendly and smile (but in appropriate doses, avoid having a grin on your face ALL THE TIME, guys that are smiling for hours in a row look terribly insecure and just plain pathetic).
-   Don’t focus on your health problems or ailments.
-   Don’t brag about yourself and your accomplishments. There are exceptions though, but try to be careful about them. If you really have something impressive to talk about, you can let her in on it, just try to be real casual about it. On the whole, women are very good at sniffing out when the male is trying to impress them by bragging. And if what he is bragging about is not really that impressive, it’s a complete turn-off. So be careful. Focusing on her and her interests is a far safer route to take.
-   And at all costs, avoid these three themes: politics, religion and conspiracy theories.
