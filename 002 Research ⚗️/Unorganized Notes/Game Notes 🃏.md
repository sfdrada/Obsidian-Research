### 2 Ways To Get Her Out After Her #:
1. Improve your [[Text Game]]
2. Get a more exciting life & invite her to things your doing



# 97% Make This Mistake:

## Entering Pickup
- Not exciting -> Bring energy into your interaction
- Excusing/Explaining -> Supplication/qualifying
- Don't call out pickup

Socially Favorable Reaction != Attraction


**Supplication** Altering your behavior/frame/values to please a girl


"The Boyfriend Excuse"
- Some man-woman relationship but forwardness exceeds value
- Agree & Exaggerate, Misinterperet & Agree, Exaggerate
	- *"Oh that's cool, I figured we'd talk a little bit more before we got into anything relationship like."*
	- *"I don't mind as long as you're interesting to talk to"*
- She can eventually regret she said she had a boyfriend


**Avoid the feeling of explaining or justifying yourself
- Wait and see



Create a dialouge between you and her when first getting to know each other instead of a pile of questions
- open ended questions
- Include your own opinion while asking a question
	- [[Yes And]]



# How To Pass Shit Tests

Frame Control + Passing Shit Tests = Best way to convey value
- Girls enjoy this the most


**Lead w/o being pushy

Girl w/ thick Fame: Strong sense of identity, strong confidence, doesn't easily give in.

False Time constraints
- Talk while you sit down

"You're kinda spicy" = giving shit test


Feel free to point out extremely cocky girls in an amused way


Continually bringing up man-woman by taking factual statements in conversation and redicrecting them

[[Negative Premise]]


Callback Humor: Reframing to somehting that was said before


Going Meta: Instead of trying to pass the shit test from within the interaction, go 1 sttep above and act as an observer of the interaction and commentate on it.
- No longer subjugated by test
- Good for really difficult tests


# Get A Date In 5 Minutes

Numbers take work -> Instant date is way more efficient
- gets rid of flakes and time sinks


*"I have to go in a minute but..."* + direct man-woman
- Rejection = you were leaving anyways
- Acceptance = premise established

*"Oh so you're..."* + positive attribute
- qualify or admit lack of attribute
	- challenging + assessing her frame
- Respond with [[Push-Pull]] [[Backhanded Compliment]]
- *"Oh that's something"*
	- buttressed compliment

A great way to get a girl to [[Qualify]]:
- challenge her
	- compliment can be a challenge

**As soon as a girl asks you a question on a cold approach, the  hard work is done (opener achieved)
- No longer a pickup but a genuine interaction
- You have to give your power away @ open & close
	- Make these as smooth, subtle, & meaningless as possible
		- Maintain comfort and value


*"You have a sweet & innocent face but you look like trouble"*
*"...but you have bad girl mannerisms"*
- you can use canned lines until girls call it out


**Act as if there's some resistance/hesitation on your part
- Interested but not sold [[Frame]]
*"Hey what are you doing right now this second cause you seem like an interesting person. I don't know if I'll love you or hate you but I can guarantee you're not a boring girl"*
- Sexual tension + win for her to prove herself to you

*"How do you feel about a quic dirnk w/ an attractive new friend?"*

**Girls can undermine their own shit tests if they see you as high value and don't want to lose you



# Change Your Mindset

Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic Rewards:
- Motivagted to get something done/over with
- Enjoying the process of doing the activity

[[Pareto's Principle]]

Trick the brain into enjoying the discomfort
- Narrative
- Repetition
- Intrinsic Reward
- Visualization

**Don't reward the grind, have the grind be rewarding

# How To Handle Womens Shit Tests


[[Assertiveness]]
Women will always at some point get on your bad side
- chemicals
- tests

1. Abundance Mindset
	1. They have to know you are willing to walk away
		1. Enforce boundaries about how they treat/talk to you
			1. No empty threats
				1. You can breakup to 2-4 weeks to get their respect


1. Do not argue with women/be emotional
	1. You become more feminine and she becomes more masculine


**The only way to get your woman to act right is to enforce hard boundaries and demonstrate it through your behavior



A woman likes a guy who has passions
- she doesn't want to be your purpose for happiness
	- Idolizes her

Girls want a man with a plan
- an add on to your life, not your life

Don't crowd them, get them to chase
- Get your woman to complain you guys don't spend enough time together
	- You need to look at the relationship -> supply and demand


Abundance mindset comes from constantly improving yourself
- She wants to be on her best behavior because she is worried about other girls stealing you

Keep the first date cheap since it might be a pity date
- since you had the balls to go up to her she'll give it a shot

Exchange numbers so that you can remember her name


**Everything out a womans mouth matters
- always stand up for yourself
- be the leader

1. Shit test
	1. Fail = she becomes more masculine 
	2. Pass = submissive/feminine
2. Disrespect

## Texting

A lot of good sets are lost in texting

### Texting Mistakes


If you had a really good in person interaction and agreed to plans, it’s not a bad idea to assume the case in the text

If she is busy:
- if you don’t message her between now and the time you want to hang again (next weekend), it gets cold, stale, and weird
	- Bad way to kill time = Small talk
		- can get boring
		- can lose tension
		- backwards progress
		- can go wrong 
	- Good way to kill time = Small tease & banter
		- don’t initiate too many texts a day
			- can be reasonably responsive
			- Text her every 1-3 days
		- leave some plans vague & undefined
			- gives a reason to text
			- having the plans is the highest place in texting before actually going on the plans
				- prevents from reclosing plans
			- Think of your texts as time buyers
				- Get better cost benefit 
	- Might not view you as the commodity and prioritize you
		- Don’t set the frame that they can wait, they don’t know how amazing you were, 
			- don’t be reactive to the frame she’s too busy and don’t be supportive 
	-  don’t stay on boring topics too long
		- no ability to make sexual or flirtatious
		- not generally enjoyable
	- be careful of unnecessary displays of incompetence
		- not knowing what you’re talking about
		- talking yourself down 
	- Match her blueprint in your texts
		- don’t take risks you don’t need to take
		- structure the conversation to where you talk about conversations you’re knowledgeable about, you’re the leader in, and you have value in over her




### Low Value Texting


1. Texting her too frequently
	1. Shows a lot of eagerness & desire
		1. If you care too much, this girl is very important and you don’t have much else going on in your life
		2. High value guys usually have their phones blown up by multiple girls and are very busy
	2. Waiting every single time to text is a generally bad idea
		1. When you are making plans it’s important to not wait too long between texts or else your plans will break down
		2. Can kill the momentum of the current texting and her excitement
	3. If you have a long text message to send, it can be better to send a voice message or call her on the phone
	4. If the general vibe has been you’ve been relaxed about texting her, you can change how you text her to immediate sometimes
2. Being too formal
	1. can kill the emotion and flirtation
	2. makes it look like you care way too much
		1. Bad negotiating position for determining the relationship
	3. When a girl looks at your texts it should look like you picked up the phone and wrote back the first thing that you thought
		1. Should have good content
		2. Should be a good message
		3. Should look like you didn’t invest a lot
3. Being insecure & reactive 
	1. double texting
		1. not needy if you are heading to plans
	2. Checking on how she feels to your texting
		1. Be in the position that most of the things you do in life are great and people love you for them
	3. you don’t want to be bringing to her attention that you’re thinking about her or how the texting is going
		1. just say lol obviously jk and just pass
	4. Texting should be a reflection of good internal psychology which is that she likes you, plans are inevitable, and texting is a fun formality
		1. Being analytical or mentioning it is hurting yourself


**Mental trick is to assume that texting really doesn’t matter that much
- the girls that are texting you like you no matter what
- The girls that are not in my immediate vicinity and are not talking to are low priority and you are outcome independent


### Silence
Reasons For Silence:
2. she has other things going on and you become less of a priority from boredom or staleness
3. or you did something dumb/closed too fast
4. weird random shit/oversight or technical malfunction

	If silence is happening in some dumb funny way when things are already going well, your reaction to silence should be to be entitled and call her out on it in a fun funny way
	- once it's clearly been awkwardly long
		- “hello are you alive”
		- …
		- ???
		- “earth to alien”

If you were too ballsy and over the top
- lol obviously jk anyway…

Closing when you shouldn’t have
- change the subject to something interesting and get it going again and wait till its good to close

Boring and flat conversation
- Do something instigating like a hook
	- *You wouldn’t believe I saw the funniest things today they reminded me of you*
- Send value 
	- good to have social media and number




### Todd V Texting System

A guide != a rulebook
- general context > structure



What most guys don’t know is where they’re at in the interaction
- girl really likes them & time to make plans vs. fading and they need a recovery

A general system that tells you where you’re at and what to do next

4 Types Of Text:
1. Silence
2. Shit Test
3. Logical & Platonic
4. Positive

Every text is 1 type or multiple from neighbors
- From Barely likes you → Really likes you


Common Mistakes:
- Closing when interest/investment is too low
- Never closing when high interest

Not going well:
- Convey your personality
- Offer value
- Make fun & engaging conversation
- DO NOT make plans


#### Silence

**Ping Value Into The Void
- Send funny, fun, interesting, engaging messages that don’t require a response
	- More likely to get a response and one not required 
	- More relevancy is more valuable 
- Don’t become overly invested when she isn’t responsive
- Don’t ask questions



#### Shit Test

She is putting in the time and effort to respond to you and texting you
- they like you and you should be able to make plans
- Just pass her test
	- Demonstrates you have a cool, interesting life, you’re not to reactive to her, you’re fun, you’re playful, you’re not too invested in the outcome
- DO NOT follow up afterwards w/ questions or plan
	- takes away your power and makes you needy
		- passing proved you were non needy
- Girls obsess over texts if you occasionally make it hard for them
	- Allows them to put in the effort and get invested
		- Making it too easy = no investment
		- Making it too hard = quits/doesn’t care
			- blandness / no reason to respond



#### Logical & Conversational
The finesse area

Still positives by spending time & energy texting you
- If she is doing this she likes you
	- The fundamental assumption is she likes you


If the conversation just started or was rocky:
1. Respond to the logical briefly
2. Add banter/flirtation 
	- Fun, wit, flirting to break out of platonic zone

If generally logical or generally positive:
- start making plans

General context (-): logical + banter
General context (+): logical + close


If she suddenly shit tests you, stop trying to make plans, just pass the shit test, and let it positively escalate from then


#### Positive

Start making plans != Make plans
- screen for how interested she is
- screen for her schedule

Process To Making Plans:
1. Qualifier
2. Vague Suggestion
3. Close

*Are you an adventurous person*

*What’s your views on drinks and witty banter with a cute boy*

*Find out schedule*

*Make plans*

If you are getting positives, you should be atleast briding the close
- the purpose of text is to get her off the phone and into a real conversation with you in person
	- Can call her and get her more invested to hang



## The System Pocketbook Notes

The best inner game comes from experience
- taking action and getting new data

State: Flow/presence/good mood
- don’t let it be an excuse


Get out of your head by focusing so much on the real world that you have no mental room left

## Open
The goal of opening is to start a conversation

2  points in a cold approach where you have to be a little needy
- open
- close (potentially)


As long as you get a response, you did it

Commit to the open & believe in your ability to have a conversation

## Range Of Openers
Extreme direct & indirect openers are ineffective

Risk vs. Reward

*Picture of chart in lesson*

1. Super Direct
2. Direct Man-Woman 
3. Direct Friendly
4. Push Pull
5. Observation
6. Situational Tease
7. Opinion
8. Impersonal

Beginner = 1-2
Intermediate = 3-6
Advanced = 3-7


2. Super Direct
“Hey you’re sexy, I wanted to meet you and get to know if you are someone I want to get to know”
“Hey your cute I wanted to talk to you”

Pros:
- Shows man-woman
- No time wasted
Cons:
- Reveals the game
- Gives power away
	- Revealing Game level
	- Just doesn’t get it
	- Value indicator
	- Beta characteristics
	- Not fun/mysterious

3. Direct Friendly
“Hey I love your shirt”
“Nice hair”
“You seem like you’d be interesting”

General Compliment

Pros:
- Hinting at desire
Cons:
- Not man-woman
- game revealing
  
4. Push Pull
“You look so adorably dorky”
“I love your white girl dance moves”
- Giving a compliment and taking it away at the same time

Pros:
- Implication of teasing or a negative
- man-woman
- pull away
- more power
  
Cons:
- requires skill


5. Observation
“You look like such a tourist right now”

Pros:
- Interesting
- Easy 
- more power

Cons:
- no intent
- neutral

6. Use something she did and tease her for it
- Does something silly
- makes eye contact => she’s hitting on your frame


Pros:
- Wonders about you
- less direct
- engaging
- chasing you

1. Engages conversation

Pros:
- Indirect
- engaging

Cons:
- can be bad if you don’t convert to man-woman

You can have a 6/10 opener w/ a 9/10 value 

Beginner: 
- get tot he point
- consistent interactions w/ % over skill
- man-woman interactions

Intermediate:
- Not giving too much power
- Establishes banter/sexual tension

Advanced:
- Can take any interaction and make man/woman
- Useful for difficult interactions
- Not the best, just another skillset


1. Get the best results you are capable of
2. Grow & improve your skills

Chatty → Sexual = Much greater % of success

### Approaching

Approach like they were already your friend and you expect a positive response from

Close in:
- don’t be too direct, casual strolling and talking until comfortable closeness

### Walking Behind
- Don’t be behind (chasing)
- Walk next to
- Walk 1 step ahead
	- She’ll she stop if you stop
		- If she doesn’t, keep walking w/

- Light tap when approaching behind and keep walking 1 step ahead 
- Light tap + pull @ arms length and plant your feet
	- She’ll stop and eventually turn to you
		- if not, you can walk in front of her while talking after 10-20 seconds

Don’t sprint once you get close, just walk fast


Don’t jump in front of a girl
- startles them

### Walking Towards
- Don’t stop them from 1-2 ft away
	- Stop them from 5-7 ft away
		- If they walk past you = rude
- Open when you make eye contact
	- How would you interact w/ a friend

Loose, relaxed, ambling body language

### Premise

Biggest mistake in game

Man-Woman conversation, Friend-Friend, Business interaction

Cons Of Direct Premise:
- Value dynamics
- Subtlety
- Girls experience

The more subtle the premise, the better
- “It just happened” experience


Phatic Communication: Structure, nature, and framing of the content/communication

Intent: Showing the girl interest
- “I’m interested in you”
- “I’d like to date you”
- “I’d like to fuck you”

Premise: There is a possibility that something man-woman might happen
- Having a job interview vs. being offered a job


Intent is a subset of Premise


- Develop attraction on your own
- Ability to make premise @ anytime
- Technique to implement premise

Get To The Point:
- “Hey look, I may be interested in you”
- Compliment
- “Hey you seem cool”
- “Hey I’d like tog et to know you”
- “Hey you seem interesting”

Unassertive stranger level conversations
- 100x more social pressure on her man-woman

It’s your job as the man to establish the premise & tell her what the conversation is

“Nice to meet you, bye/see you around”
- You haven’t told her what the conversation is
	- Tell the girl it’s man-woman
		- Obvious vs. subtle
		  
“Hey I thought you were cool”
“Hey you seem cool now”
“Hey I’m kind of enjoying meeting you”
“Hey you‘re kinda fun to talk to”
“Hey you’re not the worst company in the world”
“Hey y’know I just realize, you’re actually kinda cute”

If you don’t make it man-woman, the conversation will end
- Don’t worry about judgement/expectation


Admit the purpose of the conversation and start acting on that purpose

### The Impact Of Early Premise:

1. You can establish a premise @ anytime
2. Only takes 1 person
	- She has a chance to dispute premise or leave
		- If she stays, the premise still exists

Easier to establish premise early
- Relationships are based on precedent
	- Breaking precedent violates expectation
		- Manipulative/creepy w/o gradual premise
			- Smooth escape from friendzone

Ideally within the first 30s-1min establish at least a hint of premise

### Push Pull
Simplest way to establish premise w/o giving power away

Do something that shows interest then temperature/take it a way a little bit
- +-/-+


You’re really cute but you’re kinda dorky”
“I thought I loved you until you said that”
“Part of me wants to fall in love w/ you, part of me wants to run away”
“You look low-key adorable”
- Adorable = diminutive compliment
“You’re actually kinda cute”


1. Give a compliment
2. Convert compliment to push-pull


Train until instinctive

### Negative Premise

“I love you” vs. “I hate you”
- establishes just as much premise
	- Giving the job vs. the interview


“I’m not so sure I like you”
- Creates tension
- Gets her to chase your approval
“You and I are not going to get along”
“I’m not so sure were going to get along”
- One of the best + oldest premise lines


Negative premise helps w/ evaluation & narrative

“Woah that is a crazy jacket”
- How you say it makes it push pull

Premise != Intent
Premise != Showing interest
Premise = Establishing the nature of the communication
- very important for understanding sexual tension

### Implied Premise

One of them is not enough, but if you have enough throughout the interaction it will tell the girl the premise

If you are a beginner, understand the theory, but disregard implementation

Actions that do not directly give s any premise, but the fact that you did it implies that you might want to establish premise.
- Disagreeing w/ a girl/breaking rapport
- Swearing/being passionate about a subject
- Getting to know a 1 time strangers name

Your manner of being in life is that I connect with people

Anything you say:
- conveys lots of premise
- conveys some premise
- conveys no premise


The higher the premise & subtlety, the better
- paradoxical

*Chart of premise to subtly*

1. Sincere compliment
2. Man-woman compliment
3. General compliment
4. Joking intent
5. Push-pull man-woman
6. Negative premise
7. Push pull general
8. Introduce
9. Implied premise
10. Strong opinion

You want to convey as much premise as possible while giving as little power away

Delivery of premise
- make your lines, the way you go about things and your actions more subtle
If you make it very clever you’re doing something for an outcome, then you will make worse
- beginners should stay obvious because of bad delivery


Match what you say w/ the way you say things

Talk, Talk, Talk, line, Talk, Talk, Talk
- subtle & sneaky


1. More subtle = more effective
2. Less obvious = less try hard + more high value
3. If she wants to object, she’ll have to intercept you’re conversation which makes her try hard and lower value
	- Sneaking one past the goalie


High value people are just conveying themselves and if someone doesn’t react to their personality, they move on and continue their behavior until a reaction.


Negative premise != Insulting
- There’s nothing actually negative when you explain it
- Insults are mainly about things a person can’t change
	- Tension you create can’t be resolved

### Premise In Groups
1. You can have different premises for individuals
2. Premises for the group vs. the individual


Group Premise: You guys seem like fun/interesting/etc.

You do not need to be talking top your target the most out of the group
- the way you talk to them > how much


The girls friends usually will be a bigger dictator fo whether you’ll succeed or not than her
- Pay more attention to the group needs but still apply premise w/ the girl

“This girl is such a pain in the ass, how do you even deal with her”
- Establishes friends premise & sexual tension premise


### Evaluate

1. If you haven’t evaluated her, it doesn’t make sense to close
	- Why is she worthy?
		- You’re actually cool vs. You’re hot
2. Sets the right frame/context
	- She ahs to come up to your value
		- Saving up $ for something vs. buying instantly
			- qualifying + investment

You want the girl to try and win you over and invest in you


“You’re pretty, what else do you have going for you besides your looks?”
- can not qualify
- can reject frame



### Why A Girl Won’t Qualify

1. Not enough value
- No reason to invest if you seem less valuable
- Evaluating too early doesn’t work since you haven’t demonstrated your value yet
- Qualifying + investing has ton be earned
	- Open = demonstrate value → premise = make man-woman relationship → evaluate = agreement that an interview is in process + her trying to prove herself
2. No reason
- If she knows that you already like her, there is no reason to win youu over
	- Important subtly w/ open & premise
3. Too obvious
- Too blatant & unnatural
	- clear outcome in mind
4. They don’t now the right answer
- Specify what kind of answer if ambiguous 
	- scare of answering wrong



### What Creates Evaluation

1. Uncertainty about their own frame/beliefs
2. You have a HIGH value

Challenging their frame and having high value will get them to qualify and invest
- Can fight your view w/ shit tests
	- Pass them & give them back
- Flips the script
	- Motivated to see the world in your way

### Modes of Evaluation

*Drawing of evaluation*


1. Ask + Answer
- “What do you have going for you that’s cool”
- You will know if she’s bought in
- Forceful + manipulative
	- High Risk + High % Resistance
2. Challenge + Justify
- “You know, what is up w/ that shirt?”
- Obvious as a challenge of frame
	- explains = qualify
	- challenge = not qualifying
3. Lead + Follow
- You establish the thing you’d liek to be true, then as her the question ahving already giving the answer
- “I’m really into the gym more (reasons).. Honestly anyone who doesn’t go to the gym is kinda a loser. Actually you’re in decent shape, what kind of exercises do you do?”
	- Gets her to justify or feel bad
4. Value + Void
- Purely on value, no overt intent
	- Looking at her to qualify based  on your high value frame
		- Teacher questioning student in class
5. Obvious


### Disqualification
Showing the reasons why she might evaluate poorly
- Makes process seem real + encourages qualification

High value badass + soft snowflake fluffy guy does not work
- extremely incongruent
- kills all sexual tension

The more she feels she had to work, the more bough in she’ll be


Delivery Of Lines:

- The best forms of qualification are the msot subtle
	- Master subtle delivery

Very casual delivery
- If she doesn’t qaulify, change the subject

Subtlety = less try hard, more powerful, easy recovery


### Narrative

After the interaction, what is she going to tell her friends?

Premise ≈ What type of movie?
Narrative ≈ Plot of movie

### We Frame

“I, You, We”
- You and I = we → together /package deal

Using we along w/ the frame of being together is one of the most powerful things to create a narrative

Once you are evaluating her & she’s chasing your validation & investing it’s very easy to implement we


If you are worried, you can always use negative version


Bubble Of Love: You and her against the world



Plotline: 
The story you are creating together

“At first I wasn’t so sure about you, I didn’t like you really that much, but then you won me over, convinced me that you’re really cool & special & different from those other girls, and for that reason I really like you. ”
	Plot: Boy meets girl → Boy & girl have tension → Girl wins boy over → happy every after


Ex: Walk up to the girl & pretend she is your ex
- Works if you hold frame and have fun



Ex: She’s your stalker for years

Ex: She has to keep you safe from this other girl that’s trying to get you

If you never develop a narrative you will really hurt your ability to make her choose and buy in & fall in love w/ you
- Associates your relationship w/ her identity


What comfort matters & doesn’t:
- The experience of you & her together
