What Ross Jeffries suggests as an almost perfect approach is using a humorous comment to get her to laugh, then all you have to do is to follow up with anything to keep the conversation flowing towards a possibly pattern-like talk, eliciting values or any other technique described in this guide you have chosen to use.
- Light Negging (!10s) = Mystery Style
- Smut = Grandmaster Style
- Compliement (7-8s)


1.  Laughter sets a woman at ease and puts her off guard.
2. shows that you are confident and don't take the process of meeting her too seriously,
	1. You are fun]
	2. Being the value > wanting value
3. Best way to see personality
4. , LAUGHTER GIVES YOU A BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE from her that you can mention, incorporate, and future pace into HER IMAGINING CONTINUING TO HAVE FUN WITH YOU LATER!


## 3 Steps of ASF:

1. **BEGINNING** - preparation ... clothing, props, initiate an entertaining and interactive conversation (that is what an OPENER is all about).
2. **MIDDLE** - using entertaining stories and routines, you convey the humour, confidence and the other typical attractive traits, use NEGS to make them chase you, test them (stop conversation to see if they reinitiate it) and look for the indicators to see if closing is worth doing (like KINO, position and body language, laughter, etc.), usually 3 positive indicators.
3. **END** - close or eject based on the indicators. Closing will stall when you don't realise that you will succeed with the close if you have witnessed 3 positive indicators. Decide on either the kiss close or the # close. 
	1. If pressed for time, just # close
		1. Aim for kiss closes > # close

**Offer entertainment and confidence with speed.** ASF: "As far as you are concerned the girl has to be entertained by you. If she sees other guys as being more confident and more entertaining she most certainly will excuse herself to the bathroom or the bar to hook up with them later. That's why its important to work quickly so that you do not take more time than is necessary to secure a chick."
