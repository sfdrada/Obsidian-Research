According to some PUAs, women obviously want a man with these most important traits:

-   confidence
-   humour
-   smile
-   well groomed / good looks
-   ability to create an emotional connection / a feeling of romance

In addition to that, being a successful player includes:

-   being patient
-   being persistent
-   being comfortable just going up and talking to a new woman
-   finding opportunities in situations where you before did not believe there would be
-   being sensitive to how she feels/responds and modifying your approach accordingly
-   knowing how to talk to a woman to build more rapport with her
-   knowing how to talk to a woman to make her start thinking in romantic directions

Having mastered all of the above, these will add the final touch:

-   mirror her physically
-   notice her trance words, remember and use them
-   rephrase everything she says and feed it back to her
-   anchorÂ all good feelings
-   don't argue with her, be very understanding, deeply understanding - this can help create an immense rapport
-   use presuppositions to direct her actions
-   have and keep good eye contact - also helps to create an immense rapport
-   touch her
-   and always start with the cutest girl around:)
