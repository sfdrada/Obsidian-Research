**The more you wait, the bigger chances there are that she’ll leave, someone else will join her for a conversation, you start sweating and eventually chicken out, circumstances change etc.


1.  Ask some kind of OPEN ENDED approach question (it will normally begin with the word ‘what’).
	1.  you are a stranger & the woman is wary of you.
2.  Have at least one other OPEN ENDED follow up question, preferably more than one, to defend you against stalling.
	1. she’s still wary, but talking.
3. By the time you’ve reached this stage. providing your questions were interesting enough, you are “in conversation”
	1. she/they have more or less accepted you and seem to drop their barriers a lot.
