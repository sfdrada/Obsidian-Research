 You see a girl you like, but for some reason can’t do an approach (you don’t have the time, or maybe the guts, or the situation disallows it etc), at least do this – say “Hi”. Keep enough eye-contact to get a confused “Hi” in return, then continue with what you were doing (walking, working etc). Maybe you’ll never see the girl again.


 After the first three “Hi’s” the girl is still wondering, if or how she is supposed to know you.
- Approach her
- Continue the game until she approaches you

Pros:
- Lowest effort possible
- Low investment

Cons:
- might never see them again
- lack of consistency
- Lots of time wasted
- Does not build confidence or experience


**A modification of this tactic** (which seems to make some more sense) – just say “Hi” to any girl you like.
- see also Eye contact experiment
- The ones that you have exchanged “Hi”-s with are the best to use the “We already know each other”.
	- start in the middle, like with an old friend, comment on something/anything etc.
