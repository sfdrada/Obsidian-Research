Casual touching during a conversation = more fond memory

Touch one girl and other girls seeing this think its normal/good to touch you.
- Social proof
- Foot in the door


Hide interest while being very touchy

Cannot be a sudden change of behavior
- better earlier that you meet someone
	- Hold her hand longer when you meet her


 Once you’ve developed that kind of flirtatious friendship, it’s easy to spawn other such ‘friendships’ with other women

1. Pay attention to how she responds
	1. If her body responds to the nonsexual touching, gradually get more sexual


Erogenous Zones:
- Hands
- inside the elbow
- ear lobes
- cheeks
- hips 
- were the waist meets the hips
- between the fingers


**Do something that lovers do
- brush off “something” that’s stuck in her hair
-  gently stroke her cheek pretending to wipe off an eyelash
- Hug her when you guys meet
	-  a hug can also be putting your arm around her waist or shoulders when standing to her left or right and pulling her closer for a moment, or taking her hand for a moment (but not shaking it), or her elbow, or arm etc. Daniel, ASF: “KINO on the arm/hand as soon as you say hi to show her you are a sexual being.”
- 



**Set the mood of the date from the start.** When going on a date/get-together, establish the mood immediately.
- Immediatly start @ warm and friendly vs. polite and calm
- you can be all smiles when you meet her, give her a big hug right away
- take and hold her hand all the way to whereever it is that you’ll be going
	- her from slightly nervous to happy, smiling, starry-eyed and glowing



**Foot-flirting**
Touch her feet “occasionally” with your own under the table, say something like “tee hee, you are foot-flirtin’ with me?” in a joking way. \
- Look her deepely in the eyes while doing this, 
- at the right time you can actually proceed to rubbing each other’s crotches with your toes under the table

**Can't Hear You**
If she says something, lean forward as if you aren’t hearing her very well, and touch her (arm or back). Then lean back again and answer.



 the success of kino depends on whether the girl perceives you and your touch as a threat to her or not.
 - A nice guy has an easier time having girls feel he is not a threat to them. Also perceived as weak, neutral and non-sexual, all of which are major turn-offs for girls


**Protective Gesture**
In a crowded bar, if people are walking by and pushing you, there’s a way a guy can put his arm around you—not actually touching you, but behind your back so he’s sort of keeping you from getting shoved.
