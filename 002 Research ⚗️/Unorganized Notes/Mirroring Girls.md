Verbal Mirroring: Common verbal patterns, vocabulary, speech level, ideaologies
- physical mirroring > verbal mirroring


 rapport – seem to take the same poses, whether sitting or standing up. When sitting, either side by side or on opposites sides of the table – one leans forward and then the other leans forward as well, one leans backward and then the other leans backward as well, they cross their hands in the same manner, tilt their heads similarly, seem to be having similar side-activities
- all their energies and concentration is on the discussion, everything else happens subconsciously
-  they don’t even have to be having a discussion, they may just both be thinking their own thoughts… and still you can see mirroring going on – they make the same movements almost the same time without seemingly without having any perceivable interaction with the other person.

Being similar or having someone similar in your vicinity creates a feeling of ease, comfort, being understood, protected
- use the power of mirroring to create these feelings in the one you are mirroring


## Aspects Of Mirroring:
- assuming the same posture
- doing the same movements with your hands
- using your body in a similar fashion to hers
- following – doing the movements after she did them.
	-  they NEVER NOTICE it! 
		- Feeling of connection & comfort
- pacing – doing the movements the same time with her.
	- stage between following and leading is pacing – you are doing movements simultaneously.
		- So far she has been leading you but now you are coming to the stage when YOU will be leading her
- leading – if you’ve done your mirroring right, have followed and paced, then you are ready for a revelation. You can lead!
	- you can lead her into doing some pretty fun stuff
		- if it looks strange, she’ll notice it and you don’t want her conscious attention on your movements, keep her mind busy with what you’re talking about
- Another more advanced aspect, although controversial as to the effectiveness of it, is mirroring her blinking her eyes and breathing. Being able to mirror her breathing and blinking her eyes is supposed to create an even deeper rapport, but the concentration required to detect and match your breathing and blinking with hers will take away much-needed attention from what she is saying, how is she responding to your patterns, values, kino etc, so eventually this could do more harm than good.
- You can mirror anytime they can subconsciously see you


“I love it when a guy sort of mirrors my physical behavior, like when I’m sitting across from him and I lean in to say something, I like him to lean in. If I’m talking really fast, and he can keep up with me, it makes me feel like we’re in the same place. If I’m being a little frenetic and he’s slow and relaxed and laid-back, I feel really far away."
