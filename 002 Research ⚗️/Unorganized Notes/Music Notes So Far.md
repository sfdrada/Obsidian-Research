# Strumming Patterns
![[Pasted image 20220519125555.png]]

Inharmonics

Practice w/ metronome 


**Learn positions for major scale for each note


- technique
- warmup
- knowledge

whole tone scale

Mm Pentatonic - Blues/Rock

Chord-Scale Relationship

**Sing with notes to train ear & voice


*Think of sound like food*
Extensions:
- Small taste
	- 9,11,13
		- Spices/salt & pepper
- Big taste
	- 7
		- Sauce/flavor

Suspended-> 4th suspended resolves to 3
- spicy boi

**Sing using numbers
- can train ear if you don't know number and have to find it


Pick 2 songs I like and write down a number progression
=

**Arpeggiate up with a scale while singing

Voicing: Arrangement of notes in a chord w/ PERSONALITY
- guitar types
	- Different tools in a toolbox
	- Each guitar is a different color/spice

*Every sound is a frequency


EQ: Equalization of audio frequency
- Boosting/Cutting

Bridge-Middle-Neck

**Practice the voicing of the same chord in different places**

Knob 1 = Change bass
- low = bass
- high = treble
Knob 2 = Change treble

Middle does not have a tone knob


**Learn a song with chords then capo

Root = Capo fret

True chord:
M Chord = Root,M3,P5
m Chord = Root,m3,P5

Passive Chords
diminished = Root,m3,m3
augmented = Root,M3,M3

*Think of a song using tension and release (buildup & breakdown)

Open chord -> lowest pitch is root

How To Find The Key Of A Song:
- first chord of the song
- last chord of a song
- listen to the bass



Most chords: Lowest pitch is root

Most songs use? an extra chord to resolve a song
- back to home base
- Artistic choice to resolve

Positions institute - sheet music for guitar

ledger lines

Instruments range -> cleft to use

Vocalists stay w/ one cleft instead of switching


Scale != staff

Guitar + Voice = Treble clef
- 5th position

Tabs are not universal

Metronome = Tool states the time/speed of the tempo
Tempo = speed of a song

In Time

**Rythm of guitar vs. rythm of singing

Downbeat vs. upbeat -> Use hands/tap feet

**Learn how to play the styles of different songs & artists to implement into your own taste


Chords in a scale = Default wallpaper on phone
- Many songs differ from a scale


*When people write songs they throw theory out the window*


Painting a painting vs. following all the art

Theory comes after the music

Hearing music vs. Playing  through theory

Music is a universal language

Play part of a chord to change the range you play

Dynamics 

Record yourself during gigs
=



Lead Sheet: Melody + chords 
- if you know how to read you can play


Reharmonization - Changing the hcpords to what you want


In ear memidors

Metronome
- internal time
- count of where you are 

Irealbook/Ibook







All the same scale just different starting positions
# Modes

True pitch : figure out your own tambre on your own instrument and memorize it

Sandwich Approach To Learning:
- Jam
- Learn something
- Learn something
- Learn something

10 minutes of fun - 10 minutes of learning - 10 minutes of fun - 15 minutes of learning - 15 minutes of fun

Time you put in  = results

You have to become OBSESSED to become a master
=

**Learn from the Greats before you
- can influence your style & flow

Ebb n flow

All kings of incentives besides personal drive

**Use your time wisely
- If you don't use it, you lose it
	- you get to a comfortable level of ability
	- less practice but same exp
		- If you stay focused, you can learn things in less time


If you're passionate enough to elarn something that's really had, go for it

Relative minor vs. relative major

Loop chords to practice w/
=


Be aware of ringing strings
- associate sounds in your brain

Associate the sound of major with you ear
- major chords & major scales

Get comfortable w/ going up & down the neck

Make some melodies
- make sentences w/ your words
- Speak a musical phrase
- Same mechanism as speaking 
	- Musical phrase basket

Chords don't always have to be in the same key

**Start mimicking songs

3 half steps down = relative minor to major


Relative pitch vs. perfect pitch

Sing a scale w/ numbers
- peopleuse songs that match interval distance
	- Helps you remember

Happy birthday = 1-2-4-2


Solfegio
- use your numbers instead of solfeg
sing the notes of a chord


tonedear.com
- diatonic - everythnig in major scale

slash chords

Basses root vs. melody

Nashville number system

Overdriving amp

Distortionvs. loudness

INput too high -> turn speakers up


Learn riffs from songs vs. specific riffs

Learn each scale in each key up the neck
=


Open major vs. Open minor

natural notes = all letters
Whole notes = Any notes played the whole bar

Cookng - less is more sometimes

part of a bigger picture
- separate into parts



**Passion is the best driver - you will seek the answers for yourself

1. Ear Training
	1. sing while playing
	2. know your interval
	3. learn a song by ear then check afterwards if it's correct
2. Make Music
3. Technical Aspect to learn other instruments
4. Mimic and develop my own style

Learning repretoire + ear training 
- what you read makes you a better writer

Just sit down and listen to music
- surround yourslef by people who love music
- live gigs -> connections
- Play w/ people who are better than you
	- you can sit in on the last session of bands
	- lessons + tips & tricks

Carve out time just to start
- write a song a week

several ways:
- a lyric catches you
	- write it down in a voicemail or text
		- make it a habit
	- elaborate and work with it just w/ lyrics
- Just have your antennas out
- See what fits with your taste

Sitting with your instgrument and jsut make something cool
- almost waking up -> half dream state is best for creating somethign new
- record your phone ideas
- can be any instrument besideds guitar
- can try to sing a melody on top


**Write something everyday to build your chops


The numbers = all instrumetns
- scale modes
- passion builds research
- learn the range of insturments
	- transpose

Learn the styles that you like
- artists copy each other with their own style


Warmup techniques:
- spider chord fingerstyle
- play w/ a metronome
- alternate picking
- single picking
- alternating notes as you play vertically
- scales w/ metronome


String instrumetns depend on what you are passionate to learn about
- learn what canbe valuable on gigs
- no reason that it can side track you from what you like

Passion: learn the shapes of what you play so that you will remember 
- understand the structure
- take the basic riffs sheet and make it a warmup 2 times a week
- don't get too deep into theory at this
	- Learn more songs -> memorize & write note progressions



9045014291= Chris Adkins


To build your music career:
- memorize more songs - notes
- connections to other musicians
- you can produce your own music already
	- write your songs (30 min production)
- Get good w/ your skills

You can learn songs and try to dissect the production of it
- remake the song with your own production
	- effects -> how each instrument sounds
- Intro - Verse - Chorus
- Passion drives you

Keep my momentum
- be disciplined
	- cut out time  in your day to chunks
	- ear training
	- songs
	- production
	- scales + chords

Passions change overtime -> Shred till you die!!!

4. Rhythm

**We can manipulate these 4 thigns to read music

Music: an intential human consctruct related to sound and purpose (organized sound)



Chromatic Scale: You can play any/all notes
Diatonic Scale: The notes that fit in a scale/pattern

**Top musicians know the rules and chooose when to apply them

Key != Scale

Happy == major
Sad == minor

Inverting chords: Changing the octaves of some notes
- roots generally stay in the same octave


Extended Chord: Adding more notes past 7th (9th,11th,13th,etc.)
- 9th & 11th = same for major/minor
- 13th different
	- loops around again after this point




Verticle construct
- Harmony
	- chords
Horizontal construct
- Melody
	- note progression

Staff: The graph where the music is organized
Cleff: The symbol to tell  you how many lines & spaces 
- 7 types

Pitch: 7 letters A-G
Melody: Horizontal arrangement
Interval: Distance from one pitch to the next
Harmony: Verticle arrangement


Treble Clef: 2nd line is G note
Bass Glef: 2 dots are on teh F  note

 Half step: smallest interval in western music
Enharmonic: Pitches that sound the same but are3 written differently
- C# = Db

Pitch = sound you hear
Note = sound you see

Accent vs. Accent pattern

Dotted Note: Increases the length by 1/2 of the note size

Meter: Combination of accent pattern and subdivision
Simple: Beat subdivided into 2 parts
Compound: Beat subdivided into 3 parts

Simple Duple: Accent every 2 beats w/ each beat subdivided into 2 parts
Simple Triple: Accent every3 3 beats w/ each beat subdivided into 2 parts

Compound Duple: Accent every 2 beats w/ each beat subdivided into 3 parts
Compound Triple: Accent every 3 beats w/ each beat subdivided into 3 parts
