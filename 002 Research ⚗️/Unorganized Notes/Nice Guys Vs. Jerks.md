# Nice Guys Vs. Jerks



It is believed that being polite, considerate, friendly, tender, romantic, etc. is what being a "nice guy" is all about
- think women will be terrified of their sexuality

 the "jerk", the rude, the inconsiderate, the impolite, the rough guy who always gets the girl

 the "jerks" are not afraid to show that they are sexual beings, while the "nice guys" hide their sexuality as a part of their agenda of being friendly, polite, and courteous towards women.
