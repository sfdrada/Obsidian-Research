we want our personal management system to be fun



as the percentage of your notes become the words of someone elses, the percentage of your own notes on things decreases and makes it less joyful

 take notes < make notes

The most important notes are  BOAT notes
- blocks of atomic thought 





can go into graph and look at notes you want to modify under certain categories 
- very good way to stay in creative frictionless mode





Block reference inside urls using ^

[[Knowledge Management Systems 🗿#^fcd6cc]]


you can embed references using !

![[Inversion#^e8fd3c]]


can change the tag value by preemptively assigning a ^value to the object referenced at the end
- can treat as a sort of categorization tag for what you want to reference?

The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.” ^quote-movies
	  
^^ allows you to reference all blocks in your system instead of just one file

You can also do this with # or ## for headings (inside [])
