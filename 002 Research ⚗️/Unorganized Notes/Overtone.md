This is where complex tones come in. Overtones refer to other frequencies that are much higher than what is known as the “fundamental frequency”. The fundamental frequency is the pitch we hear when a note is played. Overtones are a series of pitches that compliment the fundamental frequency and give the the pitch a unique sound. This helps us differential between instruments as each instrument produces a different series of overtones. For instance, if you take a violin and a piano and play the same note you will get very different overtones.
