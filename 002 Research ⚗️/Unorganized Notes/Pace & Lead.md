"VERBALLY PACE THE ONGOING SITUATION - I cannot emphasize enough the power of this VERY important rule. Basically, what it means is to verbally describe and therefore ACKNOWLEDGE the situation and reality that she finds herself in with you.


With that in mind, I have actually USED the following approach and ACTUALLY gotten it to work! I merely wait for a nice looking young lady to come jogging, blading or biking toward my stationary position along the path. I then jump out, hold out a hand and in my most authoratative tone yell: STOP! (This is actually pretty funny to watch. I have never had them NOT stop!)

"Look, I know this is a totally nutty way to meet someone (pacing her ongoing belief)... but I knew if I didn't do SOMETHING to stop you, we'd never get a chance to talk (also completely true... a truism with which she cannot argue) and maybe see how much WE COULD REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER (embedded suggestion)".



**BY DEMONSTRATING UNDERSTANDING, YOU INCREASE RAPPORT!


I did NOT say demonstrate that YOU are "understanding, sensitive" etc. I said demonstrate "understanding"... of her ongoing reality and situation. Not in the sense of apologizing or excusing but simply that you are alert and AWARE of who she is and what she is experiencing.


From here, what I will do is say, "Look...I don't have a lot of time here (a bit of a "takeaway" which always makes you more appealing). And it's obvious that you are on the move too. But if you'll sit with me for 5 minutes, I'll analyze your handwriting. You'll get to learn secrets about yourself your best friends don't know and I'll get to find out if YOU are the kind of person I want to know better (here I'm structuring an opportunity and offering her a challenge)."
