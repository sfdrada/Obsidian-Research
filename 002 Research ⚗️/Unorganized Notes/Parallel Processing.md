- able to increase their ability to parallel process
- a limit to how much information we can process simultaneously before we have to rely on other strategies such as processing information serially
- serial bottlenecks in information processing
	- we only pay attention to the most salient information in our environment because if we paid attention to every single piece of information, we'd be overwhelmed.
