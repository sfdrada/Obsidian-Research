All time thinking:
- self
- life
- past
- future

conceptual prison != reality




Gift Analogy:

Wrapping/box = not the gift
- the thought
Object inside = real gift
- the content 
	- Can talk about a object but not be it itself

All thoughts are conceptual reality aka ideas about actual reality
- fabricated
- The thought is real but the content is conceptual
	- It is a real thought but what it is talking about is illusory
	- 

Suffering from conceptual prison
- Not experiencing life, just your ideas about life
	- distorted
	- narratives
- keeping us bound in self image
	- our ideas about who we are
		- keeping us down

Detatchment is learning to see the uselessness of conceptual grasping
- where all suffering comes from

We fail to just simply practice, too busy overanalyzing and conceptualizing


conceptual reality -> manifest reality -> unmanifest reality

### How do we improve the quality of our thoughts

Mind = river

Drinking from a river:
- dirty water
	- water is not the problem
	- dirt is the problem

Do not try to change the water, just clean the water

conditioning = impurity

meditation = cleansing impurity

You can;t change the quality of your thoughts, simply acknowledge the behavior patterns begin to transform

You can't battle against your negative thoughts you want gone
- you can try to replace with positive thoughts
	- way greater effort
		- no in depth change
		- When you are no longer alert your mind will return to it's natural frequency/conditioning

You must lose interest in the content of your mind to sink deeper 
- the ideas will lose their pull removing the perpetuation 
	- starving them out
- Don;t react, simply observe and let go of the narrative
- That which resists the practice is actually the obstacle
- Just ride the journey, the experience will take care of you
	- Hey life do whatever you want with me in whichever time frame and I must go through whatever I need to go through in order to learn the lessons I need to learn
		- This perspective doesn't allwo you to get frustrtated
			- A wise person does not get frustrated
				- only adds to misery
