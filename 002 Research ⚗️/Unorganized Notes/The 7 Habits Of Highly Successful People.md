# The 7 Habits Of Highly Successful People

focuses on the character ethic rather than the personality ethic



_"Almost all the literature in the first 150 years or so focused on what could be called the character ethic as the foundation for success — things like integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty, and the golden rule. … the character ethic taught that there are basic principles of effective living, and that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character."
-Stephen Covey


Personality ethics need to be rooted in character. The personality ethic can be seen as fake or as a fake it til you make it image if it's not rooted in character. Sometimes people apply these personality techniques in order to use and manipulate people to meet their own goals and agendas. In the long run, people will eventually see through this duplicity… but you can't fake character ethic.


imagine an iceberg. The personality ethics are above water while the character is below the water. The character forms the foundation. It is where the greatest impact over the long term is. It's where you sow the seeds. The problem is that people don't focus on the foundation, they focus on the appearance.



## Habit 3 - Put First Things First

independent
They help you become more effective as an individual by developing inner strength, character, purpose, and values.



Interdependence is the highest level level of what Stephen Covey calls the maturity continuum. The maturity continuum consists of 3 levels: dependence, independence, and interdependence.


To move from dependence to independence, you have to nail the first 3 habits. This is the attitude of I. Most people think independence is where it's at. They think it's the highest level, but in fact, interdependence is the highest level. Interdependence is where you think like a team.

We accomplish what we want together. It's the attitude of we. We can combine our talents and our abilities.





## Habit 4 - Think Win-Win

There are 6 types of personal and business relationships. Lose-win and win-lose. This is the typical mentality of most. In order for me to win, you have to lose. This is the mind set of – someone is going to get the good end of a deal and someone is going to get screwed. This is a poor mindset to have, but people live with this outlook because most people have a scarcity mind-set. Most people have a lack of abundance mind-set.

There is also the lose – lose relationship, which of course is no good for anybody.


Next, there is win. This is not really a relationship at all. This is you just getting what you want and not providing value to anyone else. It's pretty much selfish


Then there is no deal. This one is pretty much neutral. If you can't come to a deal where you both benefit, then there is no deal.

And lastly, we come to the best type of relationship – win-win. We want to look for win-win relationships. We want to search for mutual benefit and have the mind set that there is plenty out there. There is abundance. We can share knowledge, gain, and profit.. We don't need to crush each other – we can work together instead. Life isn't a zero sum game, so, look at every situation with a win win mentality.





## Habit 5 - Seek First To Understand, Then To Be Understood

- [ ] Dale Carnegie Thingy

For us to understand someone, we have to listen to them… not the other way around

We often get mad at people because they don't think the way that we think. We all see the world differently. We all see the world through our own perceptions and opinions based on our own experiences. You can't understand someone unless you really listen to them. Try to understand their perspective first. Try to understand how they are feeling and why. This is called empathic listening. This is the highest level of listening (the others being ignoring, pretending to listen, selective hearing, and attentive listening). None of these are very effective, but most of us listen using one of these levels.


Most people don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply

So, if your wife says, “I hate my job”, instead of providing advice or repeating what she said, which is the typical response, you rephrase the content and reflect the feeling and say something like, “you're not enjoying your job and you're feeling upset”. This gets you both on the same side of the table. You're listening with the intent to understand intellectually and emotionally. Then can move forward to repair the situation.



The time to be understood is when the conversation leads to logic and advice is requested.
This is when you can seek to be understood. If it goes back to emotional, then you listen again empathically until logic is brought back. This creates an atmosphere of caring.


## Habit 6 - Synergy


 different people bring different opinions, ideas, perspectives, and strengths to the table. Instead of simply tolerating or accepting these differences, we should celebrate them.  We should value these differences. This is what any good CEO does – they get their different subject matter experts and get their input to come up with the best solution.

Think of how individual units can work together to create something even bigger.




## Habit 7 - Sharpen The Saw

. We are the instruments and we have to regularly sharpen 4 areas (these areas fall into quadrant 2 activities).


Physical – Find the importance of it. Again, it's not urgent, but it is important. You can either exercise and feel good now, or pay for it in 30 years when you're in the hospital with all kids of physical aliments that you could have avoided.

Spirituality – Ask yourself, who am I? What am I? Meditate, pray, and contemplate.


Cognitive health – Continuously explore, learn, teach others, expand, and educate yourself. Read a good book


Social health (relationships) – Make an effort to spend time with friends and family. Improve your relationships

Think continuous improvement. We must continually renew ourselves. The best way to unleash your future potential is by investing – investing in yourself. Strive for continuous learning and improvement. Doing so renews each of the other habits as well


Apply these habits and teach them to others because the best way to learn is by teaching it to someone else.
