You have nothing, absolutely nothing to expect from a girl to whom you do not demonstrate value and personality.
- she will discover it being of value for her for the simple reason of liking the way that value makes her feel.


So many guys think, that their mere presence and company is of some specific value to the girl - well it is not. If you sport a great face and/or big muscles, then your presence can sometimes be a turn-on for a girl - she likes the way the proximity of your face and muscles make her feel and thus your presence can be of separate value for her. But even the few times that happens, it will wear off fast if it turns out that that is all you have to offer.


**Any time the girl is bored, disinterested, turns you down, walks away, rejects you or ignores you - you have simply not demonstrated enough value to her.


you simply need to get her attention by taking an educated guess at what she might be interested in



you are like a travelling salesman, giving girls only a foretaste of the goods and offering them an opportunity to get the real stuff... "if they behave well enough"



YOU are the goods, but you're not selling to everyone - you offer only to a select group of potential customers. But you don't need to push it, the stuff is for real and you know it, and if one customer doesn't want it, its her loss, another one will grab you gladly


nobody will want your goods if they don't even know anything about it. So sample it - by demonstrating value and personality.
