**Malls** are always full of girls. Girls who work at various stores and shops within the mall, but also a lot of girls who go shopping or just hang out.


Walk up and down the halls and look inside stores for beautiful clerks or shoppers. If it is a women's clothing store or something feminine, even better. You can easily walk up to a girl

"Excuse me. Would you be so kind to hold this up in front of you for a moment? It's my sister's birthday next week and you are about the same size as her and from what I can tell you have the same excellent fashion sense."

after the initial approach you can even ask her if she sees anything else that she really likes in the store that your sister might like too because of the similar tastes in fashion. Probe for keywords why she likes certain things over the others etc.


Expand the conversation to likes and dislikes in other areas of her life to get her view on things and so on. If she's a shopper you might want to act very quickly to finding ways for you to continue your conversation somewhere else, but if she works there she won't mind spending the time with you especially if it's not very busy



**Libraries.** If there is one place that girls almost always outnumber guys, it has to be the library. Whether it's a public library or a college/university library, you will always find young girls trying to do research for a project or homework.
- everybody can use a break once in a while. If you provide a bit of a pleasant distraction they'll be more than happy to talk to you
-  You could be asking them for some help to locate a specific section or specialty book. Even if they can't help you out they will at least have to tell you that they don't know where you can find your book. But guess what?
- These girls like to show off their knowledge so they'll tell you more than you need to know about the subject. But if you develop good rapport at this stage you can easily continue this fascinating conversation elsewhere
- You can start asking why they're interested in this particular subject, what's the most fascinating thing about it, what are the challenges and so on. Once you move to answering this type of questions then you will be able to get an insight as to what type of girl she is, what she holds dear and so on.


**Gourmet Coffee Shops.** Before work, at lunch and after work these places are packed with girls
- If it's not very busy you can still ask to sit next to a beautiful girl. Just tell her that you don't like to sit alone and if she'd mind you sitting with her till you're done with your drink.
- Her favorite drink and why she likes it over regular coffee, how does it make her feel and so on. Try and talk in detail about the different sensations and aromas. Women love descriptive talk in detail especially if it involves something that can even be compared to a sexual sensation
	-  planting all these wonderful images in her mind by using metaphors.


**Workplace or School/College.** This is a more relaxed atmosphere for seducing women because you are not under time constraints.
