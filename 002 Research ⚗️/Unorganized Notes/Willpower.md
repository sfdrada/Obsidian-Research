# Willpower
Willpower isn’t something you have or something you lack.

it’s impossible to maximize your willpower for every moment of every day,

Willpower is the ability to control oneself and the decisions one makes. It's the ability to delay gratification and choose long-term rewards over short-term rewards.


Success usually comes down to choosing the pain of discipline over the ease of distraction. And that’s exactly what delayed gratification is all about.

In other words, the child’s ability to delay gratification and display willpower was not a predetermined trait, but rather was impacted by the experiences and environment that surrounded them. In fact, the effects of the environment were almost instantaneous. 

**Your Environment Drives Your Willpower

If you take just a little bit of time today to organize your room, your office, your kitchen, and other areas, then that adjustment in your environment can guide you toward better choices even when your willpower is fading.


**Sleep Deprivation Affects Willpower

here's plenty of research to suggest that sleep deprivation is associated with decreased brain activity, [specifically in the prefrontal cortex](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00284/full#B42).
he function of the prefrontal cortex is decision making and “the orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals.”

 decrease in brain activity in the prefrontal cortex led to a [deficit in divergent thinking](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2869.2000.00225.x/full).


 When you're tired, you're probably more likely to make whatever decision comes easiest and requires the least amount of effort.






 your willpower is like a muscle. And similar to the muscles in your body, willpower can get fatigued when you use it over and over again.


the strength of your willpower fades as you make more decisions.

Decision fatigue happens every day in your life as well. If you have a particularly decision-heavy day at work, then you come home feeling drained. You might _want_ to go to the gym and workout, but your brain would rather default to the easy decision: sit on the couch. That’s decision fatigue.







## How To Overcome Decision Fatigue

**Plan daily decisions the night before.**

you won't be wasting your willpower on simple choices the next day.


Taking time to plan out, simplify, and design the repeated daily decisions will give you more mental space to make the important choices each day.


**Do the most important thing first.**


You’d want their best attention, energy, and focus to go toward the decisions that were most important

**Stop making decisions. Start making commitments.**

of course you need to decide to do the things that are important to you, but more than that you need to schedule them into your life.

Rather than hoping that I'll make the right choice each day, I've found much more success by scheduling the things that are important to me.

f you sit back and hope that you’ll be able to make the right decisions each day, then you will certainly fall victim to decision fatigue and a lack of willpower.







**If you have to make good decisions later in the day, then eat something first.**

When you want to get better decisions from your mind, put [better food](https://jamesclear.com/eat-healthy) into your body.

**Simplify.**
 the biggest frustration for most people is the feeling that you need to use willpower on an hourly basis.


If something isn't important to you, eliminate it. Making decisions about unimportant things, even if you have the time to do so, isn't a benign task. It's pulling precious energy and willpower from the things that matter.
