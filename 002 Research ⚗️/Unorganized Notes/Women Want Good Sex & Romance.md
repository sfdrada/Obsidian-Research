# Women Want Good Sex & Romance



Women are very discriminating and choosy in picking sexual partners.
- Only interested in having a sexual encounter with a partner that sexually arouses them and/or promises, by his manner or image or personality, to be "good in bed."
	- exciting, provocative, imaginative partners who will lead them through great sexual experiences.
- They will pass up just any sexual encounter waiting to find the one that promises to be special. 
	- Women know that good sex is hard to find - once they have it, they will not let go easily
